1_5,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"I like hours of uninterrupted deep work. And by “uninterrupted deep work” I mean “I look at Twitter every 15 minutes but am still able to jam words on a keyboard because no one is ‘coming by my desk’ to chat”.
 Either way, working near other people isn’t for me. But if there’s one creative story that highlights the value of physically being around others, it’s the legendary $4B Pixar lunch.
 The lunch was memorialized in a 2008 teaser trailer for the film Wall-E. Andrew Stanton — one of the most prolific Pixar directors — tells the story:
“In the summer of 1994, there was a lunch. Me, John Lasseter, Pete Docter, the late Joe Ranft all sat down [at the Hidden City Cafe in Point Richmond, California near Pixar’s head office]."
1_6,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"Toy Story was almost complete and we thought ‘well jeez, if we’re going to make another movie, we better get started now’."
1_7,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"So at that lunch, we knocked around a bunch of ideas that eventually became A Bug’s Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo. The last one we talked about that day was the story of a robot name Wall-E.”
Below is a recreation of the table napkin where the four jotted down ideas.
 Steve Jobs famously made Pixar's HQ an open structure with an atrium area where everyone had to pass through."
1_8,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"He wanted to maximize the amount of interaction between employees from different divisions (Jobs told historian Walter Isaacson that the key to creativity was serendipity). I think the $4B Pixar lunch is a version of this creativity by serendipity.  Toy Story was a smash hit, bringing in a worldwide box office of $245m (this was Hollywood's biggest haul in 1995, beating out Apollo 13 and Batman Forever). Jobs used Toy Story’s success as a launchpad for Pixar’s IPO that same year. In the following years, Pixar checked off films they ideated during that lunch:1998: A Bug’s Life ($363m, directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton)2001:Monsters Inc. ($529m, Pete Docter)2003: Finding Nemo ($871m, Andrew Stanton)2006:
Disney acquires Pixar for $7.4B. Jobs owned ~50% of Pixar and became Disney’s largest single shareholder, with a 7% stake. The massive pay-off was two decades in the making: in 1986, Jobs paid $5m to George Lucas for the graphics animation company that would become Pixar (and invested another $50m into the company).2008: Wall-E ($521m, Andrew Stanton)
The Pixar team picked Toy Story — and then A Bug’s Life and Monsters Inc. — because it was cheaper to animate toys and animals than humans (in comparison, AI can now pump out high-fidelity graphics based on a simple text prompt).
 Each story also had a straightforward-but-catchy-premise: Toy Story (“based on the belief that kids thought toys came to life when nobody was looking”), Monsters Inc. (“Docter suggested that they come up with another popular belief, that monsters were hiding in the children’s closet ready to come out and scare them”), A Bug’s Life (“build on the Aesop fable, the ant and the Grasshopper”), Finding Nemo (Stanton remembered as “a child watching the fish in the tank at the dentists office, and wondering if the fish wanted to go home”) and Wall-E (“What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?”).
 In the decade after Wall-E, Pixar released two related sequels:2013: Monsters University ($744m, Dan Scanlon)2016: Finding Nory ($1B, Andrew Stanton)All told, these films have grossed over $4B. Meanwhile, most of my lunches end with me wishing I got a Caesar Salad instead of fries (I'm still never going back to the office, though).   Links and Memes 
A $700m canned water startup: The snark was out in full-force this week on news that Liquid Death — which sells water in a can — raised $70m at a $700m valuation."
1_9,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,Dozens of cynical takes were like “how can a water company be worth so much?”. The valuation wasn’t surprising to me.

 Water is a massive category…: Bottled water has surpassed carbonated soft drinks as the top beverage category with estimated sales of $45B in 2022 (on a very related note, China’s richest person — Zhong Shanshan ($60B+) — built an empire on bottled water per The Split newsletter). 
 
 …and all about branding: Most bottled water is just re-purposed tap water."
1_14,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"Liquid Death gets water from a Denver water plant and differentiates itself by a “give no Fs” skateboarder/heavy metal brand that counts Wiz Khalife and Tony Hawk among its investors (Cessario is a former ad exec and nailed the the motto: “Murder your thirst”).
 Targeting specific demos: The origin story for Liquid Death is that Cessario was working a concert in his early-20s and noticed that the bands were drinking water out of energy drink cans."
1_15,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"Everyone needs to hydrate and some people want to look cool doing it. Liquid Death is a big hit at bars and clubs for people who don’t want to drink alcohol but want to fit in by holding something approximating an alcohol container. In a strategic coup, Liquid Death has big distribution through events giant Live Nation (which is also an investor)."

 The brand is clearly not for everyone and Cessario knows that (I interviewed Cessario back in 2020 and he quoted a line from Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard: ""If you’re not pissing off 51% of the people, you’re not trying hard enough."").
 So many cheating scandals right now: 
Chess: Over the past month, the chess world has been watching drama unfold between leading world champion Magnus Carlsen and young 19-year old upstart Hans Niemann."

Anyways, a 72-page report from Chess.com came out and said its likely that Niemann has cheated in 100+ online games during his meteoric rise into a top 50 player.

1_24,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"Adelstein accuses Lew — who’s poker hand was absolute trash — of cheating. After making some nonsensical rationalizations about her hand, Lew offers to refund Adelstein $135k and he accepts believing she cheated him (and the gesture was a quasi-admission of guilt).

 If you have any interest in poker, watch the original video, an early defense of Lew’s actions by poker superstar Daniel Negreanu (which basically boils down to people make ridiculous poker decisions all the time) and a video breakdown of a leading theory on how she cheated (a vibrating device)."
1_25,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"For the poker story, I was 90/10 leaning towards Lew just making a ridiculous play (based on my own history of making awful poker plays). But then the Casino released a note on Thursday to indicate that one of the workers had taken $15k from Lew’s pile but she declined to press charges (Lew and this worker followed each other on Twitter before he deleted his account a few days ago)."
1_26,1665223208,trungphan@workweek.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The $4B Pixar Lunch,"It’s getting weird enough that I’m leaning towards “likely cheated”.
 On news of the three scandals, people are asking “why is there so much cheating going on now?”
I don’t think it’s new. People are just getting caught."

That ranks as the country’s 4th largest industry, behind energy, banking and insurance. But ahead of cars, steel and tech.
  Here’s a very funny 5-minute Hasan Minhaj bit: “White People At Indian Weddings”.  And here some gold tweets: 

Last week, I wrote about the $600m Spirit Halloween business and how the “slap the Spirit banner on failing organizations” meme template has infinite use cases. Well, Credit Suisse has been in the news because some investors believe the Swiss bank is facing a “Lehman Moment”. The bank maintains that it’s in a strong position and has rallied in recent days."

 The Delaware judge is giving Musk until end of October to close the deal or a trial will commence in November to settle the dispute."

You can now add accordion/toggle to your site. The accordion can be set into 3 different styles: Plain, Card, and Button. 
 With our accordion feature, you’ll be able to create collapsible/expandable sections, which can come in handy when building an FAQ section.

 To add accordion to your site, simply type /accordion in a new block, then drag and drop items into the space provided.


 Custom Gradients on Text ✨
With our new feature, you can now apply custom gradients to your text as well as backgrounds (container backgrounds, buttons, etc.).
 To create custom gradients, go to Figma → create a shape → change the “Fill” from “Solid” to “Linear” or “Radial” → set gradient color → copy the CSS code. It should be linear-gradient(…) or radial-gradient(…)
Go back to Typedream → highlight the text → change text color → choose “custom color” → paste the code you got from Figma.

* This episode is part of our new Skilled Labor Series hosted by MCJ partner, Yin Lu [ https://substack.com/redirect/7f8eec7f-92e3-4186-854a-46da13a18436?r=o1saq ]. This series is focused on amplifying the voices of folks from the skilled labor workforce, including electricians, farmers, ranchers, HVAC installers, and others who are on the front lines of rewiring our infrastructure.
 To kick off our new Skilled Labor Series, this episode is co-hosted by Yin Lu and Sam Steyer, CEO and Co-Founder of Greenwork [ https://substack.com/redirect/4694e2e5-ab4e-4443-959c-a0410b1e6db4?r=o1saq ], with guest Andy Martinez, PV Field Performance Technician at Sunrun [ https://substack.com/redirect/08f77670-0d59-4851-be6c-c70183f20bf0?r=o1saq ]. 
 The solar market represents approximately 5% [ https://substack.com/redirect/981695ed-7c0a-4ec2-a642-379bbac7ff23?r=o1saq ] of the current U.S. energy mix. While this may seem insignificant, the industry is expected to grow at a record pace in coming years, especially following the Inflation Reduction Act. But to reach the clean electricity goals set by President Biden, employment in solar-related positions will need to exceed 900,000 workers by 2035 [ https://substack.com/redirect/5d0869f3-fea9-41e6-a1e5-d88382078681?r=o1saq ]. 
 Greenwork is facilitating this transition by helping climate tech companies build their construction teams, both by adding new employees and by partnering with local specialty contractors like Andy. After attending electrical trade school, Andy landed a job with Sunrun as has been with the company for 4 years. 
 In this conversation, Yin and Sam learn about Andy’s background and how he started working with Sunrun. We learn about his day-to-day experience as a field performance technician and where Andy sees his career progressing in the space. Like any job, we also hear about some of the challenges Andy faces and how he continues to overcome them while maintaining a positive and optimistic outlook. We cannot create a clean energy future without people like Andy, and are extremely grateful for him sharing his story and inspiring others.

And isn't easy:

Remember that the ""everyone else"" (on average) isn't actually
working that hard on their VC job search.

 This means that if you can put out twice the effort of the
typical (average) VC job seeker -- you'll see (more than) twice
the results.

 For example:

Aspiring VC associate #1 (Most VC job seekers): Interested in
machine learning(ML) because it's a hot space.

 Reads Techcrunch articles about machine learning to get a surface
level understanding.

 Aspiring VC associate #2 (Top 20% of VC job seekers): Reads those
same articles...

 But then spends a few hours over the weekend reading through the
TensorFlow website."
7_1,1665069894,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Getting a VC job takes 200%,"

 Aspiring VC associate #3 (You?):

 This is the 200%-er.

 She does all of the above PLUS meets with a local university
professor (or 2) who is doing ML research to learn about their
work.

 The best thing about this?

 There's nothing (really, nothing) that can stop you from being
her.

 Best,

(23.-24. März)*

 Hi Ante,

Schön Dich kennenzulernen! Ich war wirklich großer Fan von deinem Podcast
mit Arthur, die Wachstumsgeschichte von Moss ist wirklich einzigartig!

 START Summit, *Europas grösste Studenten-geführte Startup-Konferenz*,
verbindet die Gründer von morgen mit den heutigen Leadern des Startup
Ökosystems! Genau deswegen wollen wir Dich zu einem *25-minütigen Fireside
Chat* zum START Summit (*23. und 24. März 2023)* nach St. Gallen, Schweiz,
einladen. Beim Thema des kommenden Summits, *Reaching for Resilience*,
beschäftigen wir uns mit den Herausforderungen von Entrepreneuren durch das
veränderte Marktumfeld.

* Zum letzten Summit:* 2022 war ein voller Erfolg mit über *3500 Teilnehmer* aus
ganz Europa, und Speakern 
wie * Luciana
Lixandru* (Sequoia), *Daniel Weinand* (Shopify) oder *Neil Rimer* (Index
Ventures). Lass Dich vom Aftermovie  selbst
überzeugen!

 Wir werden übrigens auch bei *Bits & Pretzels* sein. Wir würden dir gerne
noch mehr Background & Outlook geben, wenn du hier *10’ Zeit* hast!"

 That's because over time, your digital thoughts become less of
your thoughts. As you clip more articles, the ratio of your own
words and thoughts decrease. This makes it harder to search for
your thoughts. While each article feels important at the time,
they almost always cause more harm than good.

 I have a whole story about this (

Will humanity show how it can accomplish what everyone previously thought impossible and innovate our way out of a deep hole?
 Each year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation publishes its “Goalkeepers” report which attempts to answer the question, “How is the world doing?” With a microchip inside of everyone who took a COVID vaccine, no one is in a better position to answer that question than Gates.
 Seven years ago, the foundation and 193 countries agreed on a set of 2030 objectives on topics ranging from poverty to gender equality, and this annual report aims to provide data-driven updates on these goals. The upshot of this year’s report is this: things are generally getting better (and in the context of history, have never been better!), but we have fallen significantly behind on the necessary pace of progress to achieve the 2030 goals. 
 The pandemic diverted resources, women’s rights have suffered due to changes of power in the middle east and law changes in the US, and the war in Ukraine has kicked off a potential food crisis."

 Felix Salmon [ https://substack.com/redirect/6ff4db9d-68d0-4c98-a7af-c6feabb988d3?r=o1saq ] for Axios
While much of the Gates Foundation’s work on poverty is focused on efforts abroad, there have been significant improvements over the last decade in the US. On Tuesday, the US Census Bureau released its 2021 report on poverty, inequality, and health insurance coverage [ https://substack.com/redirect/29f629b6-7d6f-44fc-a32e-93b75c37fff0?r=o1saq ] which highlighted a dramatic decrease in child poverty in 2021. The decrease was due, in part, to COVID-era child tax credits which contributed to 3.4 million American children being lifted out of poverty between 2020 and 2021. While such dramatic decreases are unlikely to repeat — in fact, there may be a rare increase in 2022 — the general downwards slope of child poverty since 2012 is encouraging. In the past decade, nearly 10 million (the combined total populations of NYC + Philadelphia) American children have been lifted out of poverty.

While the merge doesn’t solve all of Ethereum’s issues — namely, it doesn’t make it faster or cheaper (that’s for future planned upgrades) — it does reduce the blockchain’s energy consumption by ~99.9% and lets owners stake their ETH to generate a yield in exchange for maintaining the ledger.

(4) DOE Report Finds Hundreds of Retiring Coal Plant Sites Could Convert to Nuclear [ https://substack.com/redirect/f8382d1f-7373-463b-ae2e-b8b903ad84e0?r=o1saq ]
"
20_19,1663332949,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #12,"The study investigated the benefits and challenges of converting retiring coal plant sites into nuclear plant sites. After screening recently retired and active coal plant sites, the study team identified 157 retired coal plant sites and 237 operating coal plant sites as potential candidates for a coal-to-nuclear transition. Of these sites, the team found that 80% are good candidates to host advanced reactors smaller than the gigawatt scale.
 It’s become increasingly apparent (or at least politically more acceptable) that nuclear energy is going to play a big part in achieving the U.S.’ emissions goals. As we wrote about in “Working Harder and Smarter [ https://substack.com/redirect/dd21280e-4564-4495-874e-2f5c2eda629e?r=o1saq ],” if we’re going to realize the full potential of the Abundance Renaissance, we are going to need a lot more energy. 
 According to the Department of Energy’s report, the coal-to-nuclear transition will not only make our energy grid cleaner, but unlock new building opportunities, jobs and tax revenues. But we won’t need to start from scratch — much of our existing infrastructure can repurposed to power this next wave of energy production. The potential benefits are staggering. From the report:
Greenhouse gas emissions in a region could fall by 86% when nuclear power plants replace large coal plants, which is equivalent to taking more than 500,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the roads.
 For each conversion, jobs in the region could increase by more than 650 permanent positions. 
 Long-term job impacts could lead to additional annual economic activity of $275 million, implying an increase of 92% tax revenue for the local county when compared to the operating coal power.
 The reuse of coal infrastructure for advanced nuclear reactors could also reduce costs for developing new nuclear technology, saving from 15% to 35% in construction costs.

Rather than selling the company or taking it public, Mr. Chouinard, his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia, valued at about $3 billion, to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization. They were created to preserve the company’s independence and ensure that all of its profits — some $100 million a year — are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe.
 In a move that many Patagonia vest-wearing types may not agree with, Yvon Chouinard, has essentially given away his $3 billion ($100 million per year cash flow) apparel brand to a climate-focused non-profit. And, believe it or not, according to The New York Times, he didn’t do it to take advantage of any kind of tax loophole. 
 Chouniard’s motivation seems two-fold: 
1) Influence a new form of “capitalism x philanthropy” 
2) Give away as much of his personal wealth to fighting the impacts of climate change
On the first motivation, we could lay out all the reasons why this won’t work and share lessons on incentives and capitalism — but fuck it, if Chouinard wants to give away his fortune to test out this new model, more power to him."

Patagonia’s most important customers will likely now spend more at Patagonia over the course of their lifetime. Let’s say that the lack of financial incentive means that Patagonia will be managed 20% worse over the next ten years…I’d bet, though, that this move increases CLTV by greater than 20% over that same period."

Hainan's special economic zone allowed Zhong to source products at artificially low prices. He started selling these personally throughout other parts of China, pocketing the difference. This eventually got him terminated from Wahaha and planted the seeds for Nongfu Spring, kicking off a 30-year rivalry for China's water market.

 Building Trust With Event-Based Marketing
Zhong is rumored to have personally invested in over 100 businesses ( https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/meet-zhong-shanshan-a-reclusive-entrepreneur-who-became-asias-richest-person-with-85-bn-worth/articleshow/81429148.cms )."
25_29,1665153960,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,China's Water King: The Fifth Grade Dropout Who Built Two $10 Billion --  Companies,"For each brand Zhong and Nongfu launches, he identifies a unique entry positioning in the market. For example, his ""Mother's Original Beef Sticks"" brand has a story about a boarding school student who's mother spent years perfecting the perfect beef recipe, sending him weeks of supply at a time. Sharing the beef with classmates made her son the most popular student in school. Parents identified with the snack and bought it for their kids.
 Zhong first launched his Turtle Pills through intimate closed door events. This helped build consumer trust with what was at the time an entirely new product category. Nongfu's water product first launched as a tastier and safer alternative to tap water. Zhong ran national TV campaigns centered around global events, building social proof through inspiring ads during the World Cup and Olympics.

 Liquid Death: Building Distribution Through Unique Product and Event-Based Marketing
Re-visiting Liquid Death ( https://liquiddeath.com/ ), its co-founder and CEO Mike Cessario ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mike+cessario ) had the insight to create a water brand catered to an alternative culture. With its skull logo, flavors like ""Berry It Alive"" and ""Mango Chainsaw"", and trademark #DeathToPlastic hashtag, it has similarly leveraged unique product positioning. And its flashy aluminum cans:
· Taste better than bottled water: Taste is subjective depending on the consumer, but canned water stays colder for longer. Plastic containers also often leak chemicals and plastic flavoring from the container into the water, which impacts how it tastes.

· Are more environmentally friendly than plastic: Aluminum cans create ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-aluminium-insight/plastic-bottles-vs-aluminum-cans-wholl-win-the-global-water-fight-idUSKBN1WW0J5 ) 2x more carbon per unit than single-use plastic when produced, however are known to be infinitely recyclable. Even if its difficult to measure the exact carbon footprint, the perception of single-use plastic has soured over the years, especially with younger consumers (which is ultimately a marketing strategy).

· Look like alcohol: This may seem small, but arguably the largest emerging trend in beverage is low or no alcohol drinks. This is often discreet ( https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/business/non-alcoholic-trend/index.html ), and Liquid Death looks like it could be a heavy IPA, hard cider, or even a canned soda.

· Develop unique distribution channels: While most retailers sell bottled water, many restaurants and liquor stores don't."

 Science thinks Liquid Death may be the fastest ( https://medium.com/scienceinc/leading-liquid-deaths-series-d-6f026ce806a3 ) growing non-alcoholic beverage of all-time, reaching the same revenue as Monster ($47 billion valuation today) and Celsius ($7 billion) within three years vs four and 12 years, respectively.
 Earlier this week Liquid Death announced ( https://www.bevnet.com/news/2022/liquid-death-to-launch-iced-teas-begin-shift-to-u-s-production-in-2023/ ) an iced tea brand launching in 2023. It also sold a ""bong water ( https://www.thirstyfornews.com/2021/12/08/wiz-khalifa-partnering-with-liquid-death-for-mountain-bong-water/ )"" in partnership with Wiz Khalifa - literally the same water in a new can, hinting at the potential in adjacent products like THC-infused water.

But that reset for companies that are growing without profits hasn’t fully translated to the private markets yet.  “It will take some time for entrepreneurs to accept that growth is priced differently, and we have a stalemate now,” he said of the reset forced by shrinking P/E ratios on the S&P 500. “We’re waiting for that,” Ford said, adding that ""it will clear itself in a few years."

And it’s not as if going public has worked well for many of the high-growth tech names. 
 “They have not gotten the benefit of going public,” he said, citing a lack of long-term shareholders staying with a company and an inability to raise additional capital. 
 Ford’s message to his own portfolio companies is to extend their runway for thinking about an exit, and to manage costs and key performance indicators on a path to long-term profitability."

Traditionally, markets will be winnowed down to two or three competitors before the winners become clear to investors, but in the past few years there were as many as eight companies going public in high-growth tech sectors."

 He added that some of the companies that went public, currently trading at deep discounts, are now missing important growth numbers. They are also no closer to attractive levels of profitability and will likely go private, according to Ford. Still, the jury is out as to whether or not the overall washout has reached its end game.

Last month, software developer Felix Krause seemingly exposed the existence of JavaScript commands (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ5Q5mNXLV3Zsc37CgWh-W1w1yf-2wRBwVW60M0PJ1YVqcKVrxmRm2WGwHjW6Vs_4w1Ms67XW7KnyJP4QwQNSW1N8vHd65wXd-W1hdWQw69j-ygW72zRkS1cwmjCN7NdQctVN2dSW65xnW83dFm2fW6T1K6648k24JW25qDWc8b-Hr7W3rS75x2bpWq2W3WHXNs1ZwcNpW4y3fT92NNN3_W9gZ2qq98ZQP2W66nNPf3p212vW2SYKz93qZwWbW7XFQ617d68gxW61_1z62SwtLmW3DY3yj388TGzW48dt2h1qTHwDW1lQHx761mv-fW4p78Wb7fSZ4GN1JwP3ypdschW1nYL065BxcTHW23stnB7NpvLQW4DBfW07Q5JSFW6wl79L2TB6hKV4cLbf5z6GpCW6584l48dkkb0W8YCG326SZb5NW50wLJW8Vdf7kN2W2Nf79pNvz3qpC1 ) within in-app browsers in Facebook’s, Instagram’s, and TikTok’s Apple iOS apps. Each app developer’s JavaScript file injects code when a user clicks (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ5Q5mNXLV3Zsc37CgYhkW1QX6VT3hZJwdN4yMN6kzc3XBW6cNh1J1SL4GlW4nKpS44MpwB5W507bPm7vlpS2W1W-8kZ2cFtyjW6ZPNfj6YjPbjW7J5XZ68wSX9kW196dwR6Vxy8GW5yHr2X9fS43pW8r9Kc868-RL9W8y4BW03lf9JqW2t0cZw2JX5htW8w6nF2295S03W4g1DK48qXp9tW2L4GvH681r26W3vC1xH2dZgHGW6xWQwh37Bj99W18h8m24mbL_YW2Lc7SH5YkxMvW9h2sD06qkbpfW3BXYwb5KB7n4W58GNtr4MVFbjW6x8rBL8r1Vl3W4rKd_D90JrNJW5Dtpsp1T-VMKN5yRJr_G__0tW5D5QCJ5h4T-wW2Mkb2W8JdqRSW1nFGYv7K-27qW688HbF2YwC-kW8tM3Pg743HcVW7Sn_zw7ycd29Vn830D3g6xn03g6z1 ) on a link or an ad, forcing her to third-party websites through the in-app browser instead of the user’s default browser. As Krause noted, if he is on to something, app developers can use their in-app browsers to monitor user activity on third-party websites without consent. Although the App Store’s review policies do not prohibit in-app browsers from tracking user activity across third-party websites, the injection of these specific JavaScript commands to in-app browsers seems to conflict with Apple’s recent brand campaigns and its focus on user privacy, likely epitomized by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ7h3pds1V1-WJV7CgNpYW402cm35y0xR0W2p8C619hrYyXW6T7sNl53VFQzTstb94Tz2PvV7X25K4p4B-KW7tbCFS2NHWJsVBfCyx2wjsDNW11H-Kg6hf583W56wmFP2f03FtW2CFDt65f6T16W1tYlDj8hRQ-KN8qGhSgxydzJW25b0YQ6j1_7GW4vSk0f6JXGQCW4vCrgd3mwzD-W9g3DL83122h2W6Zs1yn4-5Z8GW5YF5SW2sWkgxVs9Qlg5L_9grW8_Pyvs52cXL0W4Rw5T73pGrs_W9h7mZd62ZlnxW5HJ0CB4GQx_qW3Ghnxn955xR3W3Q_mhj2bNVRqW95-4fB59s_DxW1Y22dG3m-QbBW8LtP1Y1Vhj9N3fbC1 ) with the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021."
28_7,1662987973,ark@arkinvest.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,"JavaScript Injections Enable Social Platforms To Track User --  Activity On Apple iOS In-App Browsers, And More...","Again, if Krause is correct, Meta and TikTok could monitor all user activity occurring within their in-app browsers, including interactions on third-party websites with user interface (UI) elements such as search fields and text boxes. While Meta does not force its users to rely on specific in-app browsers, TikTok obscures address bars completely and does not permit users to reopen links in their chosen browsers. According to Krause, the JavaScript code enables TikTok to monitor all keyboard inputs, including user payment and other personal information in third-party in-app browsers.

 While Meta and TikTok use in-app browsers to help measure advertising efficacy in a post-ATT setting, Apple could respond to potentially malicious activity and privacy risks by restricting app developer usage of WKWebView (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ6_3pdrLV1-WJV7CgHhJVmY9Tk5CZGZ6W6vPsNw89nmdfN58RP1cZ8qtHW5bFQp15F9JjgN4RRthGmfVRvW5PR61Z2w4HfsW4MZQpy75Hl8NW3jgZst6dYvvQW6yB1n91gQSlmW5gP7Rv6p5JLqW4Zw16z2z-m_zW5sM8n393DHL2W2MpTqY6zvmmRW1t_pxS6YPDdQW6p0Bdq7D1sbzW6Mzy_s5WJmx-W24CQyx6L1BG5W667zdz2d5TC7W6BCk306lDbltMcw48CYj2LlW5pVwyY6fJBw_W4Hc8Kb5DN9vwW36J93p3q03XrW1r6vvy2zdbvdW8zFBwy2r3V0pW8SPgXd8CCMGB3dwD1 ) , a more customizable and flexible application programming interface (API) than the Apple-recommended SFSafariViewController (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ7h3pds1V1-WJV7CgXTSW2Y4-3J976MtlW5VnQ558lgQrLW94FQQ92b5kHsW1TjSM56vkLW_W3htMTh462YzhW31TLxH5nFj7NW6C_ZY49bWDBjW3dqDcq5vpxd6N8-3xLHqDc0gW2qHWnH2clNkyW4_tg_K6LQsZQVh0_2H7cKCtNW4T4s3s1QtcLFW664VNZ58hjWLW8w7W963yP_SpW8yD-Zz1Cj83LW268w_q7v1pNDW7-pzdG3Y08F8V-Gg8M5W_1FrW1cj9rQ6Vc38dW4M74pr8L1RZcW5L3wL83kxv7kV6bwxB77Jkv8W3JFKNG6g8bDrW4vT3Qg5qHkzFW1DF83b6RdQ4TW1PbQxH5jn0XlW8PkXjg2sTyKZ33Sv1 ) . Apple is unlikely to ban the use of in-app browsers altogether, but it could restrict WKWebView-based browsers, limiting the amount of traffic going to third-party websites and, as a result, any incremental ability of social platforms to measure the impact of their ads.

Synthetic biology involves genetically engineering small organisms like bacteria, giving them abilities that improve medicine, manufacturing, and agriculture. Thanks to the convergence of high-throughput, low-cost platform technologies like CRISPR gene-editing and next generation sequencing (NGS), synthetic biologists are designing, building, and testing organismal designs faster and more cost-effectively than ever, leading to an explosion in innovation.

This modified yeast strain produced Vinblastine, a popular anti-cancer medication that relies on a rare plant called the Madagascar periwinkle (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ6_3pdrLV1-WJV7Cg-5DW1N2N7v6yr7zsW5gb_sr3_j3bhW455PR96mBs64W4VY-Ct7Gk6mNW7mpSmF4ZV5XZW2_Tf6l8t7vy5W7bZd9r4vlpKsW9j16BX2yW3zwVHm6wd84Cg07N8bhC48VsPjdW1Bh5G_3dpP2-V-WSJr2Kxp52W9jQ6Pk3hX7pcW5M--_06SwLmxW4MxNy_5mwXfBW1fvFmf9jZMFlN4jgWtZwy_wfW6dyGYh6nkr1DW89ln1P6vqsS-W2BLMnk4n8tj2N7K4_0zd_YnFW349DnV8KVb9wW2mZB2V5hXtbNW3dFry67kpyD6N6VFH2NSp0trW4Ps3Fp5TH6j2395N1 ) that fell victim to COVID-19 supply chain bottlenecks. Novo Nordisk’s synthetic biology breakthrough solved that problem for this much-needed anti-cancer medicine.

 In our view, this accomplishment offers a glimpse into the enormous human and economic value that synthetic biology is likely to create. Moreover, most of the research is generalizable across more than 3,000 natural products closely related to Vinblastine."

Last week, Apple released its annual lineup (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ6J3pdrrV1-WJV7CgHg7V3YM336N2Bn5W1dn-vS2Vm-k8W261s506krfl4VW7-Tz6952ydW6K1tY88rdw-PW3FPPGk2bxjkGW2-ChlZ3Dkf74W88tBrB7z4HPTW3l1DwK8dFCKgW6z6fHp5S_snVW1lTwgh9lsT9hW4GL50q6QdWbtW4dsXTx6M0ks4W1q-9LV6g2HkYW3kTt-x5Sft0JW6jk9N85r38QNW2blqfF8V3dbqW91fqmg71_lGzW5dDGHc4L2kf-W6-v0Ry7VKD54W7X8msb98NWG3W4v-4F11hvb1CW52lyR05MDvv2W63xSwV1FfZ-s361J1 ) of new iPhones and upgraded peripherals. For the same $799 price point as the iPhone13, the new iPhone 14 features an upgrade to the A15 Bionic chip that improves battery life and photography. It priced its larger-screen option, the iPhone 14 Plus, at $899. Holding the $999 price point, the Pro series also featured notable upgrades, including a brighter and always-on display, an improved camera with more professional photo and video capabilities, and a “dynamic island” that tightly integrates hardware and software to display adaptive, persistent notifications––a nice touch.

 Catering to extreme athletes, the new ruggedized Watch Ultra boasts longer battery life, more accurate dual-frequency GPS, a dedicated activity button, better waterproofing, and an emergency siren. Priced at $799, this new premium watch will compete head-to-head with Garmin’s range of high-end sports watches.

 While we believe it is likely to sell many Watch Ultras, Apple probably will be unable to poach many from Garmin’s loyal customer base."

The phones require clear line of sight, however, forcing users to track satellites. Importantly, only the new iPhones enable the SOS capability––in contrast to the forthcoming T-Mobile and SpaceX offering (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWLGQs5SCPF0W8KZ5_l8TySlnW7bJF9w4PThKrN3mxJ7B3pdskV1-WJV7CgBJXW4_2QKF1J7JDqW4S3RmV2Sc-BNW2H6S-f6LppRcM9GnSW1xNQ9W1RfVbG4-kLTDW7tS_dB5PHVFTMvwkMwGqPQ6Vs4ZXr4PxXC5W4ZPN3N7M5dhbW26mJgj5RGrnQW8DckLr3QqGQGW3yngrb7dVq1FW3jYQzl1_KtWzW4Pty-Z3vXg8QVLv4Z_1_Rn4zW5-NZKb6zPwqQW7kQ3gp5vSfPPW3bl-fk1_KkghN3nfQ98wZ9MvW7wvJ6n8m0jsVN3rkDX-y8gLDW8j861Z79TBwCW36jb-k7mwv1dW8j5nB96FWNrhW5twcmN7Qj6rJW22j4p26M6pj0W25wj1B1VZQPzW1r6X2V59wQJHN1GLgB4kWzCbW4qHgVD7jvNws3j001 ) which works with existing devices.

 As its form factors mature, relying on incremental improvements to processors, displays, cameras, and batteries, Apple’s ability to deliver shock-and-awe iPhone updates appears to be waning. New features like the “dynamic island” and crash detection do depend, however, on the integration of software and hardware at which Apple excels.

In the Nuro partnership, we wonder if Uber will lower delivery costs, increase its profit margins, raise the wages of the humans still involved in the process, or all three?

 Fact of the week

Apple released its annual lineup of new iPhones and upgraded peripherals. For the same $799 price point as the iPhone13, the new iPhone 14 features an upgrade to the A15 Bionic chip that improves battery life and photography.

Ah, the prototypical workhorse of internal tools: the admin panel.
 The easiest way to think about the admin panel is as an internal interface to your production database. Recall that most applications are built from two important pieces:
A frontend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lays out the visual structure and interactivity of your app, and interfaces with the backend
A backend comprising the database, API endpoints sitting in front of it, and any other data-related logic hidden from your users
That frontend is what you’re reading this post in right now if you’re on the web, and the backend is storing the content, your profile information, etc. Underneath it all lies a database, probably a relational one [ https://substack.com/redirect/70935aec-ccf2-4279-a87f-9e191ba53ef9?r=o1saq ], storing and managing all of the data needed to run your app. It probably has a users table, a table that stores payment information, and a table for the canonical unit of your app (a tee shirt listing, a post on Substack, etc.).
"
34_8,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"The frontend for whatever app you’re using – be it Substack or Gmail – is designed around specific actions that users need to take. For Substack, those actions might be:
Loading a post
Subscribing to a newsletter
Searching through a newsletter’s archive
Changing your credit card information
"
34_9,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"These are the things you want your users to be able to do, and so the frontend / APIs of your app are designed to facilitate said things."

We don’t want them to be able to edit the information of other users, or see another user’s credit card info.
 But that set of things that your users need to do is very different from what other teams at your company might need. Your customer support team needs to be able to refund orders, see a user’s order history, change their address, etc. In other words, they need to interface with the database in different ways than your users, and this is where admin panels come in.
 An admin panel is an internal frontend that lets your team members interact with your app’s database, usually to accomplish operational tasks like refunding orders, fixing bugs, changing profile information, seeing up to date sales numbers, etc. Here’s an example of an admin panel that lets a support team view and search users and orders, add a new one to the database, and edit their information:
This is only accessible to internal team members, so you’d never be able to see or use this as a user of the app.

Authentication [ https://substack.com/redirect/b3ba899a-9484-4520-ab57-6b1e1cbabd4f?r=o1saq ] is how you identify yourself to apps and software around the web. If you’re wondering how one might authenticate for an internal tool like this: it could either be gated behind username and password at a publicly accessible URL (e.g. adminpanel.substack.com), or could be hosted on a company’s internal servers inaccessible to the public, and you’d need to be on the company’s VPN [ https://substack.com/redirect/eccaf3f1-bdfd-48ab-bc37-3acdbd3e4ff9?r=o1saq ] to access it.
 🧠 Jog your memory 🧠
Pretty much every company in the universe has an admin panel like this if they’ve got users. At DigitalOcean we had a giant admin panel called Atlantis (everything was nautical themed) with literally thousands of actions you could take for each user (shut down their account, give them a discount, etc.). 
 ## Different types of internal tools
Though ubiquitous, admin panels are far from the only type of internal tools you’ll see engineers build. Command line tools, buttons to kick off scripts, a CI/CD server [ https://substack.com/redirect/5e32a7cf-68a6-4ae8-89bd-6e6d91032f25?r=o1saq ], you name it – these are all within the fray."
34_12,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"I’ve found that a few basic distinctions can help break down all of the different tools you could reasonably expect to see:
### For functional teams vs. for engineering
Some internal tools are built by engineers for non-engineers, while others are built by engineers for themselves. Admin panels are usually built by engineers for non-engineers, who can’t interface directly with the database (i.e. don’t know SQL), and even if they could, want a cleaner interface for doing common admin tasks. Though the nomenclature is far from precise, another good example of a tool like this is a basic dashboard that shows the number of active users on a given day.
 ### UI driven vs. CLI driven
Engineers build tons of internal tools for their own teams, too, and most of those tools will often not have a graphical user interface. The definition of “tool” has some nuance here, but a few examples:
CI/CD servers, tests, and workflows
Scripts for building development environments
Tools and workflows for access controls
As companies get more advanced: ML model serving platforms, internal Kubernetes [ https://substack.com/redirect/c85d2485-16d5-47f0-a8e2-4fd2e48916c8?r=o1saq ] interfaces, etc.
 You use these tools via the command line, running scripts, etc. as opposed to navigating to a URL and seeing a bunch of buttons and tables. The bigger the company gets and the more engineers they have, the more of these kinds of tools will start popping up.
 ### Data oriented vs. workflow oriented
The admin panel we looked at above is just an interface on top of a company’s database, following that good old frontend/backend paradigm we’ve talked about so much here at Technically. Other types of related internal tools like dashboards follow the same model.
 But not all internal tools are just reading from and writing to a database – many relate to workflows, where you need to make a few “things” happen in sequence. For example, you may have read the nicely formatted bulleted list above and wondered “what the hell is a script for building a development environment?” – and you of course trusted me to explain later. Well now it is later:
Developers work on the app and build new features on a local (on their computer) copy of the app, the actual live version of which lives in the cloud
To get that local app up and running, there’s a good deal of configuration involved
E.g. spinning up Docker containers, installing packages, making sure everything has the correct version, running tests
At some point in the early company lifecycle, developers will package all of the requisite commands for the above into a single, nice file that you can run, making this all a lot easier
Is a script with 8 commands in sequence really a “tool?”"
34_13,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"And if not, what is a “tool?” Who can say for sure – certainly not me.
"
34_14,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"## What makes internal tools different from external ones
If you’ve gotten this far you’re probably wondering why we’ve spent an entire issue of Technically talking about internal tools, and, my dear reader, your curiosity is valid. The answer is that (a) tons, probably somewhere around 30%, of developer time gets spent on these tools, and (b) they carry very different constraints around how they’re built, maintained, and measured. 
 I’ve heard it said that building software is a feedback loop consisting, roughly, of something like: 
We build something → we see what impact it has → we use that information to build something else → and so on and so forth 
With internal tools, the mechanics of this loop are all out of whack relative to external facing applications.
 ### Who the user is
The users of normal applications are external to the company, regular old joes like me or you or your roommate or your mom’s new friend Gary who seems to be around the house a lot."
34_15,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"For internal tools, the users are, you guessed it, internal."
34_16,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"This changes how the tools get built:
Smaller user base → more qualitative feedback, less quantitative
In theory, less money at stake → fewer resources (more on this below)
 Usually no product managers → engineers working directly with users
No alternatives → your internal users must use the tool
For these and other reasons, internal tools can sometimes get a bad rep internally, i.e. as an engineer you’d hate to get stuck building internal stuff when you could be building external stuff. There are a lot of exceptions to this – especially at larger companies, where internal tools can be groundbreaking and interesting stuff – but I’ve found it generally holds.
 ### Prioritization
Without a direct tie to growth and revenue, internal tools often struggle to get the same level of resourcing, care, and maintenance as your core, external application does. If a company only has 120 engineering hours a week to allocate, it’s more likely that time goes to your actual app than the janky tool your customer support team uses to refund orders.
 This creates a (sadly) vicious cycle where internal tools are often the bane of existence for teams that use them."
34_17,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"Poorly designed UIs, buggy functionality, and slow updates are the norm, not the exception; because engineers are usually working on something else.
 ### Measuring success
If I build a new feature and 75% of my existing user base starts using it immediately, that's a decent signal (but not a perfect one) that building the feature was a good idea."

Generally (very generally)"
34_22,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,", engineering teams want their user-facing applications to be built with the most cutting edge technology and frameworks – faster, more reliable apps means happier users."
34_23,1663263340,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What do internal engineering tools look like?,"Today that probably means some combination of React or Vue on the frontend, Node / JavaScript on the backend, and maybe Rust or Go if you’re feeling fancy. Even if the initial application was built years ago on something older, newer parts will be built with newer frameworks, and sometimes teams will even migrate the entire app to a newer set of technology.
 For internal tools though, because of the resourcing and priority constraints, they’re often stuck on older tech like PHP, or whatever was around when the tool was built. There are also a few internal-admin specific frameworks tied to web frameworks like DjangoAdmin [ https://substack.com/redirect/af547dd7-be2e-44c9-a8d4-effdf83dbb43?r=o1saq ] that (in theory) provide admin panel-like functionality out of the box. Low code solutions like Retool [ https://substack.com/redirect/25765836-52d6-478a-8ac1-c1c82c9e6a8d?r=o1saq ] are making it easier for engineers to build these tools faster without needing to set everything up from scratch. 
 For more information and stats about how internal tools get built and what engineers think of them, I’d highly recommend checking out Retool’s survey and report here [ https://substack.com/redirect/fec6ec30-7e10-41ba-baaf-9c5f29945c00?r=o1saq ]."

 Bloomberg just announced Pinduoduo, one of the largest ecommerce platforms in China, is preparing a US launch this September. Its unclear exactly what this will look like, but I'll break down what I know.

Pinduoduo Readies US Launch
Bloomberg reported ( http://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/VX5Jeg2DMgI1k0SStgCs-zr3O4dkMALFvxkmtdu9U9yOI8wd4_GmRgk8LVvmTszimaDi9qUnibMYv-twNCu_OFBNCUQz5iqu-FjoEQU7RCoM8QZFMO4IbBXIASc-1EKx-v02Xxn8tOmY4o4RlMWGDMElU3R-G1dmONbVoALPats/3ou/tDx08OW9TWOyCLQVZXuffQ/t1/UJuLFqfDuKoC6cnt9X_hc9-L4wprvQoZbLPpleu097o ) yesterday that Pinduoduo (PDD) was preparing to enter the US market."
37_3,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"If you're unfamiliar, PDD is the largest ecommerce platform in China by active shoppers (roughly 882 million). It was founded in 2015, IPO'd in 2018, and briefly surpassed a $200 billion market cap in 2021 before pulling back alongside the broader Chinese markets to currently trade at a $60 billion valuation.
"
37_4,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,Why did Pinduoduo rise so fast?
37_5,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"There are many reasons, the main being it flipped the retailing model from supply-driven to demand-driven. This meant cutting out middlemen and predicting the exact amount of a product customers would order, then working with suppliers to fill that demand. This is now done through an advertising platform where merchants bid for demand to fill their excess production capacity. PDD's founder Colin Huang calls this ""Consumer to Manufacturer"", or C2M. As it plans a US launch, I'd expect Pinduoduo to borrow elements of its C2M model.
 View image: ( http://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/OZEo8SoB1hSKR53J1oM4sopnoG9ZGAjoINuWsEX9rkPRpOn14hydqsNeLykas5rSDFxJQs4ICbQGaIbRTCGVrzPkWGHwwYfc1tf3njHbw2bKIXRJ-5fpESWuKB9hxcmzqNH082fnyIHmSOydTWk4Zg/3ou/tDx08OW9TWOyCLQVZXuffQ/t2/a2AK68DmsGmKq8qly_sdKcee-GA84mxE2UD_rsDc9Xk )
Pinduoduo started by selling fruits directly from farmers via WeChat text message groups, and then expanded into other grocery products. Groceries are a frequent retentive purchase, however have lower margins relative to most other ecommerce categories. PDD's initial delivery provider was SF Express, and its rumored to have received favorable terms (Wang Wei the SF Express founder was an angel investor in PDD)."
37_6,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"Over time PDD went deeper with its food suppliers, building software for them to run their farms more efficiently.  PDD also expanded into community group buying, where a ""community group leader"" runs their own business on the platform. CGLs essentially use their home as a distribution hub and acquire end-customers, performing both the marketing and last mile logistics.
 Pinduoduo eventually expanded beyond groceries into other products like clothing, household goods, appliances, and electronics. This was around the time the US-China trade war began, and PDD helped local factories that lost business selling products to overseas brands (who then marked up prices 5-10x) sell domestically. PDD eventually helped some merchants create ""manufacturer owned brands"".
"
37_7,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"View image: ( http://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/OZEo8SoB1hSKR53J1oM4sopnoG9ZGAjoINuWsEX9rkPRpOn14hydqsNeLykas5rSRa0bcvADEr0KamlRdONi3fFzo01gsqEJliVBcg-p16B0X5unhYnGJgXeBkVqf0kWBjKRB87VnLxAic3AEIozpw/3ou/tDx08OW9TWOyCLQVZXuffQ/t3/kIuWvBtX2nmIdS0uzcfXrUZCXqN9kXCgi1SrUwvlC-Q )
As the Chinese economy slowed post-COVID, it's not surprising to see Pinduoduo look internationally for growth. Much of its merchant base has sold cross-border, and are likely already utilizing platforms like AliExpress and Wish to sell outside China. If PDD can successfully aggregate demand internationally, it gives its C2M model more leverage and makes it more valuable to its local merchants as it competes against Alibaba (which already sells internationally) and JD in China.
 Inspired by SHEIN's success, we may see either a) a similar launch in clothing / beauty, or b) a launch category where Pinduoduo has a strong merchant base, like household goods (appliances, furniture, textiles) or electronics. The top three retailers in the US appliance market (Lowe's, Home Depot, and Best Buy) have ~72% market share ( http://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/VX5Jeg2DMgI1k0SStgCs-3xcZ33QQgCl0RJbtrWpxkvoZ__L_Dp905ftvTHKlqx-BOhbxe1HGUrMCfypv8yjJkvO2CtBAmdQ7-seIqSUQXGkZEaF51OndjyPIIVdnHbCNh3C6xabbfZEJcHQk6OjmF7XqJ80_EpxIkmQ3xKXyRA/3ou/tDx08OW9TWOyCLQVZXuffQ/t4/Qf89oGZ71MSdqWYFMO_t36qnOKDGoYR8XM-jUxHd4Zw ). And the US furniture market is worth $227 billion, almost 5x larger than China's $50 billion."
37_8,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"SHEIN is in these categories already, however PDD could give its suppliers more volume and pass further savings on to US consumers.

"
37_10,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"Pinduoduo will need to navigate the long lead-times and expensive delivery costs of North American ecommerce. Appliances or furniture have high Average Order Values (AOVs), which would present an opportunity for PDD's discounting + team purchase model. Beauty, clothing, and textiles would lead to faster repurchase rates that mirror PDD's initial success with grocery in China.  PDD's new US offering is reportedly free for merchants, and we may see PDD lean into categories where SHEIN has lower volume. This would allow it to be much more merchant friendly. 
"
37_11,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"Pinduoduo's rise in China coincided with free, uncompetitive traffic as WeChat gained prominence across the country. PDD may look for similar cheap or free traffic in the US. They're late to TikTok as SHEIN took full advantage years ago."
37_12,1661263568,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo Plans US Launch,"But its possible there's still another year or so left of TikTok algorithm arbitrage. They could also leverage recent widespread adoption of Shopify by small brands to quickly onboard products and tap into their excess inventory (a space I've been personally been interested in).
"

Zoom's enterprise business remains strong: the number of customers generating $100,000 or more in trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue grew 37% year-over-year, and the total number of enterprise customers grew 18% to ~204,000 customers.

Management guided to a 7.5% year-over-year decline this fiscal year and noted that approximately 70% of the online segment has crossed the 16-month retention threshold at which management believes churn decreases significantly. We believe churn in this segment should normalize by the end of 2022 as customers with a preference for physical communications churn over the next two quarters.

With 4 million seats, Zoom Phone now accounts for ~10% of total revenue but only 1% of the total available market. Launched just six months ago (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVCGh26jgjtZN189BvLhNl0CW6fpr4J4PbyHLN1k24YD3pdrLV1-WJV7CgWtzW5ydG8D7ZB5X1W6dbk8w13WdyLW8Xhn054Q07xkW48sX097drz8bW4lhvt-5Lm5CDW1N2dLc1Z8_kkW7NLH6M1_T2FbW6DQd5S782lhHW3mbZ-z7GW-lhW11jYwX3wSmD_W1wvW0P1G57wqW4z5gDc48SQfJW6mC95d4ySz2hW3kxPz71gn_KyN4-GrFX9zSvKW166bYD21sjTMVN_SHV28sYG3W6KbGYs1sfn64VBftrC8QXq-JN2z_k08PfMsLVxBGGc26Znx4W4gz-H65jcbzxMHlX7wN_lzHVQJN1N8Bb61mW9gDpDc3pcZTfW69Zvt44s260R3l5b1 ) , Zoom Contact Center won a 1,000-seat deal last quarter––its largest so far––and the average seat count has reached triple digits.

 We maintain our high conviction in Zoom and its potential to become a leading communications platform for enterprise-to-enterprise communication.

The deal includes a 47.5% stake in Yoox Net-a-Porter Group and the migration of all Richemont and Yoox Net-a-Porter operations to Farfetch's primary digital marketplace and backend e-commerce / e-concession services. The new partnership follows a flurry of other Farfetch deals (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVCGh26jgjtZN189BvLhNl0CW6fpr4J4PbyHLN1k24XL5mNY1V3Zsc37CgCd8W7c5_HT3T3yMLW1g01_K63LxJXW3BPfkL7jtqWdVs3_QZ18rC20W19XwKL3l7cMHW3YfJ2J8tmTBCW8SqLM42F_zW6W95Xg6G1L-DqRW1YJJw933wrvZW10yfys78v9QyW97KHfD577dXSN7T_MwhR_1TxW4nQRYz7N1FvdW6VBCRk2QXl08W6MQxwX6wBsRxVYb6yf8jDK-7W4qgC5h3_VXsYW5gN6BJ4VQybwW6xhT1M57Y9q1W7Gkbs48g_pWRN5G2MSXVsJGNW17rs0t4PrRGtV4DrG11yZClcW4ShqKJ6zB5MhW1SbylG5xtPj7W77S0rJ4dFMB3N4T_htM-mJQtW8bhx6r31LydhN5gVJ5_WhtVkW88J76h1DklB2W1Dt-jT262N8YN2YlF2JPPrm2W5xMPFM8cWg02W5NGGRl1St-H7W9d52p33F40ndW5N1QN21jCz_83j_11 ) with Reebok, Neiman Marcus, and Salvatore Ferragamo this year. In our view, the addition of Richemont and Yoox Net-a-Porter's online gross merchandise value (GMV) to the Farfetch portfolio will contribute significantly to its growth in 2023 or 2024. Farfetch operates online and physical marketplaces for luxury retail goods internationally, as well as back-end technology solutions for third-party retailers. We believe the company is well-positioned to monetize on luxury retail's shift from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and e-concession business models. While macro headwinds could continue to challenge Farfetch in the near and medium term, we believe in its potential to become the dominant online destination for all personal luxury goods.

Your ideaverse.

 Your ideaverse is the entire universe of ideas that exists
between you and every place you think.

 Our thoughts and our environment play together as one.
 Your ideaverse consists of the connections between your brain,
your body, and every part of your environment—especially your
personal notes, but also the tree you walked by, the conversation
you just had, and the jolt of butterflies you just felt in your
stomach.

 It also includes a space that may become your most valuable
thinking environment: your digital ideaverse of linked notes.

 Hey Dominik! SchÃ¶n, Dich kennenzulernen. Bin selbst HSG Alum und trage immer gerne bei. Ich hatte das GefÃ¼hl, dass das Thema letztes Jahr stark resoniert hat. Die GrÃ¼nder/innen haben offen Ã¼ber ihre Herausforderungen gesprochen und keine Show daraus gemacht.

 WÃ¼rde mich freuen / unterstÃ¼tze gerne, dieses Thema wieder auf dem Summit zu platzieren. Was denkst Du?

Hallo Tim,

seit wir am 6. Juli 2022 mit der Nachricht rausgegangen sind, dass wir
die erste Frauenmannschaft des FC Viktoria
Berlin 
übernehmen und das Ziel haben, sie in 5 Jahren in die 1. Bundesliga zu
führen, hat ein unfassbares Abenteuer begonnen. Dieses erlebt heute den
nächsten Höhepunkt:



Wir haben gerade auf
dem SPOBIS  2022 
bekannt gegeben, dass wir 87
Investor:innen  für unseren
Club gewinnen konnten, die insgesamt 1 Millionen Euro Kapital zur
Verfügung stellen.  ⭐️

Darunter sind tolle Frauen, wie Maria Höfl-Riesch, Carolin Kebekus,
Dunja Hayali, Elisabeth Furtwängler, Nikeata Thompson und Anke Huber.
 Damit kommen wir unserer großen Mission - den Berliner Frauenfußball
in die Bundesliga zu führen und den Frauen-Sport in ganz Deutschland
nachhaltig zu verändern - Schritt für Schritt und Spiel für Spiel
näher. "

 UND: Die Berlinerin und zweifache Schwimmweltmeisterin Franziska van
Almsick  geht in unseren
Aufsichtsrat. Mit dieser besonderen Ausnahmesportlerin werden wir dem
Frauenfußball zu noch mehr Sichtbarkeit verhelfen.

 Aber damit nicht genug der guten Nachrichten: Wir sind unheimlich stolz,
dass wir Stepstone als Hauptsponsor und Douglas als zweiten Sponsor für
den FC Viktoria Berlin gewinnen konnten. Damit haben wir zwei große
starke Partner an unserer Seite, um den FC Viktoria Berlin nach vorne zu
bringen.  Sebastian Dettmers, CEO von Stepstone, und Tina Müller, CEO
von Douglas, waren die ersten, die am 6. Juli gratuliert und gesagt
haben, dass sie uns gerne auf unserer spannenden Reise begleiten würden
- wie schön, dass sich der Kreis hier jetzt schließt!"

He spent seven years in TradFi credit at Citi, where he was most recently running a structured credit trading desk, before leaving to run operations at Capchase with a focus on risk, underwriting, and portfolio management. After leaving Capchase, he matriculated at Harvard Business School before dropping out to go full-time on crypto as Head of Credit at BlockTower [ https://substack.com/redirect/1d908aef-fd8d-4e43-b67c-a831ccbe8a5a?r=o1saq ].

The inability to tolerate this inefficiency, along with the clear business case for modernizing our financial infrastructure, informed his life’s mission of removing wasteful basis points from the loans and securitizations that make the economy go ‘round. 
 Originally a crypto skeptic, Kevin became convinced that blockchains offered a credibly neutral way for lenders to work together more directly and efficiently, and decided to dive in. Over the course of our call, what struck me was that Kevin wasn’t speaking in ideological language at all.

 DeFi created $OHM, a financial perpetual motion machine, rendering millenia of economic teachings obsolete
People would be able to earn ever larger sums by simply walking or even sleeping
WAGMI because our shitcoins had inherent value (and certainly not because of an incestuous daisy chain of leverage)
 The crazy thing is this truly does not even scratch the surface of the madness. @DrNickA offers a hilarious and cringeworthy recap here for those interested:
That said, despite being a skeptic of some recent crypto “innovation,” I was so compelled by the vision of a more efficient financial system that I dropped out of Harvard Business School to join BlockTower, a stalwart digital asset investment manager, in February. Founded in 2017 by Matthew Goetz and Ari Paul, BlockTower gave me a window into what was really happening beneath the surface of crypto.
 And I have never had more conviction that I am in the right place, at the right time, and in the right industry. 
 To explain, I’ll frame the opportunity I see in the following way:
The goal: engineering cheaper cost of capital to borrowers
The problem: our anachronistic securitization infrastructure today sucks and extracts a tax on us all
The solution: the pursuit of efficiencies and new possibilities through blockchain

 The Case for Real-World Lending On-Chain
We know the future
One of my all-time favorite insights is the following from Jeff Bezos:
…'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?’… It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, 'Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,' or 'I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly.' Impossible… When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.
 To paraphrase, the man knows the damn future. Bezos knew that customers would continue to want lower prices, more selection, and faster delivery, and thus devoted tremendous energy to pursue those goals through Amazon. When the path forward is uncertain, it’s helpful to have a north star.
 So, what do we, BlockTower’s credit geeks, know about the future?"

The cheaper the cost of borrowing (X%), the more profit you stand to make (until efficient markets drive down Y%). With that incentive, who would ever ask for a higher X%?

52_25,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"But, for better or for worse, securitizations have played a critical role in making the provision of credit more efficient. To understand how, let’s use the example of a typical mortgage-backed security (MBS).
 Any mortgage-backed security can be thought of as a traditional company. Unlike traditional companies, however, where assets are factories, IP, or human capital; here, the “company’s” assets are mortgages, whose value derives from the contractual obligation of the underlying borrowers to make payments according to a fixed schedule. The company, in the form of a bankruptcy remote SPV, purchases these assets through a sale of liabilities to investors. These liabilities, or the tranches of the MBS, exhibit similar characteristics to any corporate capital structure: there are senior claims (tranches), junior tranches, equity claims (residuals), and so on. 
 Thus, a basic capital structure of a MBS could look like this:
What’s the point of all this financial engineering? At a high level, securitizations ratchet down the cost of credit through 3 main principles: 
Law of Large Numbers
If you had to bet $1,000 dollars on coin flips, would you feel more comfortable betting $1,000 on one coin flip or $1 per coin flip repeated a thousand times? For risk-averse investors (i.e., debt investors), the latter is clearly preferred because one would expect the realized results to trend towards the true odds, or 50/50. 
 The same is true in lending. Even if I knew the probability that a loan would default, the idiosyncratic risks associated with a single loan are impossible to price. What if the borrower loses their job? What if an asteroid hit the town? Pooling these loans into a securitization dulls the impact of these exogenous, binary risks and increases an investor’s confidence that they will, in aggregate, perform according to the underwritten expectations. As a rule of thumb, the higher an investor’s degree of confidence in the outcome, the lower the returns one will demand.

"
52_27,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"If you want many, many things to be able to interoperate with many, many other things, there needs to be a narrow waist that is as constrained as possible between them.
 -Alex Danco
Securitization is a form of standardization that enables very distinct forms of debt, ranging from 1-month credit card receivables to 30-year mortgages, to be purchased by and traded amongst investors. The “narrow waist” in securitizations is a 9-character identifier (CUSIP), a unit of ownership somewhat analogous to a unit of stock ownership in the equity markets. 
 Imagine if you could only trade shares of Tesla for other auto manufacturers; rational investors would require a greater discount to purchase that asset due to the relative illiquidity. Tranches of securitizations, standardized as CUSIPs (with consensus around cashflow waterfalls, legal structures, etc.), allow investors to trade very different forms of debt for each other, increasing the liquidity of their investments and lowering the rate of return they demand.

People are different, and so are investors."
52_29,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"Conservative investors, like banks or insurance companies, optimize for principal preservation. Others, like hedge funds, seek higher risk-adjusted returns. By creating senior and junior tranches, whereby higher-yielding junior tranches incur losses before lower-yielding senior tranches, you can cut up an asset into the distinct profiles that investors want. More competition, for both tranches, decreases investor leverage and often results in a lower aggregate cost of financing.
 Pooling, standardizing, and tranching a pool of loans via securitization allows lenders to borrow at a lower-rate (X%). Say a lender has originated 100 $1 million loans, each yielding 10%. In securitized form, the senior debt may be a $70 million tranche yielding 4% and the junior debt a $30 million tranche yielding 15% (the standard target for hedge funds). As discussed above, investors are happy to pay this because they get a diversified pool of assets, with greater liquidity, and a better match for their preferences. But those pools of assets are now financed, by banks and hedge funds, at a weighted average cost-of-capital of 7.3%."
52_30,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"This is the lower X%! 
 The question is, though, who gets the 2.7% (or Y%)?"
52_31,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"Part of this is fair compensation for lenders, but make no mistake: a significant portion of this spread is a symptom of our archaic securitization infrastructure and third-party fee extraction.
 Too many hands in the cookie jar
Our modern securitization infrastructure  is held together by a patchwork of PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and an absurd network of third parties that don’t need, or even want, to be involved. To give you a sense, PWC provides a great visual on the typical assortment of external parties and service providers in a typical securitization:
Orange boxes above the dotted line represent the key parties – obligors (the mortgage borrower), the originator (the lender that created the mortgage), and the investor (the buyer of the pooled mortgages). The core function of the securitization is to aggregate cash from the underlying obligors, divvy them up, and distribute the cash to investors.
 Why do we need 14 service providers to do that?"
52_32,1659963480,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Everything is Broken,"Let’s dig into the typical monthly flow of funds for a securitization:
Borrower pays: Mortgage borrowers send loan payments to an originator or servicer
Servicer remits the payment: Payments are sent to the securitization’s bank account
Custodial agents track loan performance: The custodial agent, which “owns” the loan (PDF loan documents) on behalf of the securitization, allocates each dollar to the underlying loan to document ongoing loan performance
Calculation agents determine payouts: The calculation agent calculates the principal and interest due to each tranche of the securitization
Paying agents pays: The paying agent debits the securitization’s bank account and wires the dollars due to each tranche to DTCC (a central clearing system that custodies most public U.S. securitization tranches on behalf of investors)
DTCC distributes the payments: The dollars are sent to custodial agents, which are often prime brokers
Prime brokers pays investors : Prime brokers remit the cash due to investors in each tranche, depending on their pro-rata ownership share 
Auditors review everything: All transactions are documented by the reporting agent for auditors
Trustees aggregate a report: Trustees generate a monthly “trustee report,” which allow investors to track performance and verify payments were made correctly
Costs are accumulated each step of the way, adding an estimated 1% over the life of a securitization [ https://substack.com/redirect/dd17dec6-c989-4563-9275-6f077d3c6fd4?r=o1saq ]. This might seem small, but even a 0.50% interest rate reduction on a $500,000 mortgage saves $2,500 per year of post-tax salary, which is a meaningful difference in most people’s lives! That is a staggering cost for performing simple arithmetic, distributing cash according to a series of “if/then” statements, and providing an accurate report of transactions.

Instigation: I call up John, my favorite bond trader on Wall Street, and say “hey, I’m looking for this particular tranche and willing to pay $Z.”
Sourcing: John calls up a few hedge funds, but no one knows who owns the tranche I’m looking for. One ventures a guess that it’s Tim, over at Fund A. Luckily, John took Tim out to Lavo last week, so he gives him a call.

That means that, all things equal, investors demand a higher yield on their mortgage-backed securities.

 It may be controversial to say that we’ve reached the theoretical limits of our existing system. But it’s not controversial to say that our existing system is like Windows XP; I’m pretty sure that a good portion of the “tech stack” on Wall Street is still a macro-enabled 1997 Excel Workbook.

Hi Eva,
Vielen Dank für deine Antwort.

 Bitte entschuldige meine Hartnäckigkeit, aber ich bin überzeugt
Hanno's Teilnahem wäre eine große Bereicherung für alle teilnehmenden
Studierenden und zukünftigen GründerInnen.
 Wäre eine virtuelle Teilnahme für Hanno eine Option? Wir habe aus unseren
Erfahrungen aus letztem Jahr gemerkt, dass es aufgrund des geringen
Zeitaufwands, deutlich einfacher ist virtuell teilzunehmen. Ich glaube ein
hybrides Interview mit Hanno und bspw. Judith Dada könnte immer noch sehr
spanned sein.

 Beste Grüsse und einen guten Start in die Woche,

Frohes Neues Jahr und gratuliere zur Wahl als Gründer des Jahres!

 Auch nochmals ein großes Dankeschön, dass wir letztes Jahr das Homecoming
Wknd im Personio Office durchführen durften.

 Ich schreibe dir, weil mich START Global, eine Studenteninitiative bei der
ich 2014/15 Präsident war, gebeten hat, dich  als Speaker zu ihrer
Konferenz START Summit am* 24. und 25. März in St.Gallen *einladen.

 Sie fänden es super spannend dich für einen *30-min Fireside Chat* über
deine Founding Story und größten Learnings als Entrepreneur begrüßen zu

 Thema dieses Jahr ist “*Bolder Founders. Better Future*”, im Anhang ist
noch ein Twopager mit mehr Details. Andere Speaker dieses Jahr sind unter
anderem Luciana Lixandru, Christian Angermayer und auch einige CTDM Alumni
wie Judith Dada und Erik Muttersbach.

 Ich habe Tim Birkhofer vom diesjährigen Team schon in CC gesetzt. Wäre
toll, dich am Summit zu sehen.

 Outsourcing can come with headaches. It can be challenging to decide on the right vendor, compare prices, and track project progress. While contract research organizations (CROs) are an important part of the modern biotech ecosystem, these partnerships come at a cost.
 Cromatic is on a mission to help modern biotechs make the most out of outsourcing. Their vision is to develop the infrastructure necessary to make contract management a painless, daresay enjoyable, experience. Cromatic makes outsourcing easier than ever so you can focus on the science.

66_7,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"One of the most frequent questions I get from LPs and potential LPs is why in the world Not Boring Capital would invest in biotech. Historically, biotech has been a very specific and separate discipline from traditional venture investing. Getting a therapeutic to market is risky at best, and even if it works, it’s incredibly cash consumptive. A small fund investing in early stage biotech is bound to be diluted to smithereens by exit time. 
 But Elliot’s thesis, of which I’ve become convinced over many conversations with both him and founders building in the space, is that there’s an enormous shift afoot in which biotech companies are beginning to look a lot like software companies did a decade or so ago, propelled by forces akin to the rise of AWS, founder-friendliness, and a growing ecosystem of primitives with which to build. Founders are getting closer and closer to programming atoms like software engineers program bits. The capital, and team size, needed to start and scale these businesses is declining. Multi-billion dollar outcomes and 100x returns are becoming more frequent.

 An Elliot Hershberg Guest Post for Not Boring
Sometimes new words and terminology are necessary before we can fully internalize the change taking place around us. 
 We needed the notion of the World Wide Web before we could truly capitalize on the promise of a global network of computers. Today, Web3 is a term that encompasses a broad set of ideas about where the Internet should go next.
 An important transition is also taking place in the world of biotech. From the headline news of Google DeepMind solving protein structure prediction [ https://substack.com/redirect/5320f0d2-4616-4bd5-bb64-2fdb682ca4a8?r=o1saq ], to the recent completion [ https://substack.com/redirect/f30bc983-9f7d-44d9-92e5-441814aff694?r=o1saq ] of the human genome, the frontier of biology has become deeply integrated with AI, software, and hardware. The new generation of hybrid companies on the cutting edge of this trend are often referred to as techbio companies.
 This new intersection between bits and atoms is a really big deal. In a world where the cost of developing new drugs is increasing exponentially [ https://substack.com/redirect/78fca5a0-8e6c-4c13-8df8-1832b07840f0?r=o1saq ] and healthcare takes up an unsustainable portion of our GDP, something needs to change. Beyond developing more medicines cheaper and faster, techbio could help us live longer [ https://substack.com/redirect/616ec68f-61d9-40f3-b191-db908ed4ca16?r=o1saq ] and healthier lives in material abundance made possible through the biologization of our industrial processes.

66_13,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"But what actually is a techbio company? What are the defining characteristics of this new category? Here, I will attempt to contribute to the challenging and highly imperfect science of taxonomy by answering this question. With new words and terms, there needs to also be a shared understanding of what they mean.
 As the first generation of techbio companies mature and the ecosystem evolves, patterns are beginning to emerge."
66_14,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"The techbio companies of tomorrow will likely be:
Founder-led 🧑‍🔬🥼
Deeply integrated 🧬🖥️
Backed by new services 🔬🧪
 Massive 💰🚀
It’s time to unpack each of these components."
66_15,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,Let’s jump in!
66_16,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"🧬
Founder-led 🧑‍🔬🥼
In the world of tech, a movement focusing on “founder-led startups” would seem redundant and obvious."
66_17,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"Of course founders lead startups, who else would?"
66_18,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"However, this wasn’t always the case. In the era before nearly all VCs touted themselves as “founder friendly [ https://substack.com/redirect/45449eee-16d8-4d55-b646-914b9b8f263c?r=o1saq ]” there was a very different approach to company creation and management.
 Well before the existence of the YC library [ https://substack.com/redirect/1a2ec0fa-3ea5-4cb0-b0f4-a6862a2d6a90?r=o1saq ], AngelList, and other resources that underpin the modern startup ecosystem, VC looked very different from what it is today. In 1972, just one year after the term “Silicon Valley” was coined, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers became the world’s largest venture capital partnership after raising an $8 million dollar fund. This new fund was born directly out of two of the most important companies in Silicon Valley history.
 Gene Kleiner was one of the iconic Traitorous Eight [ https://substack.com/redirect/15b39ff6-c8b0-47a2-a654-e7895512ea9a?r=o1saq ] employees who decided to leave the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to found Fairchild Semiconductor. His new partner Tom Perkins had learned directly from David Packard at HP. When they joined forces to start a fund, venture capital was still a nascent practice. There was no such thing as deal flow for VCs. According to Kleiner, “We just didn’t wait around for deals to come to us. You had to create the deals to be really successful.”
"
66_19,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"In practice, this meant partnering with university professors or entrepreneurs from existing large companies, and taking active management positions in the new ventures. An example of this is Tandem Computers [ https://substack.com/redirect/3b74e567-f35f-4b85-bf3e-a60f3d63b86c?r=o1saq ], one of the fund’s early wins."
66_20,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"The company sold fault-tolerant computer systems. The CEO was Jimmy Treybig, a former HP colleague. Tom Perkins served as the chairman of the company from when it was founded until a merger over 20 years later.
 Obviously, a lot has changed in the 50 years since Kleiner Perkins first opened its doors on Sand Hill Road. The computer industry has exploded, giving birth to the software industry and the Web. With each generation, founders have gotten younger and companies have become more massive."
66_21,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"While the first founders of Kleiner Perkins portfolio companies were former colleagues with deep roots in the early computer industry, the list now includes Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the brilliant young computer scientists who dropped out of their PhDs at Stanford to found Google.

They have delivered on their early vision [ https://substack.com/redirect/b6acbd27-fea6-41c5-abba-5d6fe743cf53?r=o1saq ] of building a tool that would “allow users to creatively express themselves online.”"
66_24,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"Figma was founded by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace who met while undergrads at Brown. Dylan was awarded the Thiel Fellowship [ https://substack.com/redirect/af73398e-4989-4e2f-beac-06b685e38c1a?r=o1saq ] to drop out of college and work on Figma full time. A 2013 TechCrunch article [ https://substack.com/redirect/20d435be-b752-4561-a769-c2a2d59a43a1?r=o1saq ] covering Figma’s $3.8 million seed round summed it up nicely saying, “Children are our future, and VCs are giving them the cash to make it happen.”
 A lot had to happen for tech to reach this stage."
66_25,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"Computers had to become substantially cheaper, faster, and more widespread."
66_26,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"An enormous amount of engineering had to happen to make computer science more accessible and standardized. Programming languages had to evolve to more closely approximate natural language, encapsulating lower level details with clever abstractions. Modern browsers are so complex that even brilliant programmers like John Carmack struggle to keep track of all of the steps [ https://substack.com/redirect/92fddb86-1dc6-4f45-bd19-1ff588b3960a?r=o1saq ] involved in rendering the text you’re reading now. But browsers have a crucial property: they provide a nearly universal platform that can be used to build new platforms. The browser was the core platform that enabled two brilliant young people to launch a company providing a new platform for creative expression. It took several layers of platforms to launch The Great Online Game [ https://substack.com/redirect/7407c205-681f-495c-9a1b-65c06ff114ca?r=o1saq ].
 In most cases, biotech company creation looks nothing like the current paradigm in tech. Current biotech venture capital much more closely resembles the state of affairs 50 years ago when Kleiner Perkins was founded. The first generation of specialist biotech investors followed a similar playbook to the Tandem Computers days. The process involved identifying promising science from academic labs and building out a management team to commercialize it, with venture capitalists often taking an active role.
 More recently, this process has been systematized by venture creation funds and companies."
66_27,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"Some of the funds most commonly associated with this strategy are Atlas [ https://substack.com/redirect/86f237a2-b5c6-48fa-a5ad-6b4f84b8f0a4?r=o1saq ], Third Rock [ https://substack.com/redirect/86f237a2-b5c6-48fa-a5ad-6b4f84b8f0a4?r=o1saq ], and Flagship [ https://substack.com/redirect/f430ebf8-5329-4ec4-8857-29eb069c5c35?r=o1saq ], which are all based in the Boston area. While there is variability in the mechanics between these types of funds, the core practice is the same: new companies are internally ideated, financed, and incubated within the walls of VC funds.
 There are two major challenges associated with this model:
It has struggled to scale
Ownership and decision making is often delegated away from scientists
While the Web startup ecosystem has rapidly expanded, company creation in biotech has actually slowed down:
Part of this trend can be explained by the fixed scaling properties of venture creation. Any given fund can only build a finite number of new companies at a given time. It’s only possible for one fund to do the scientific ideation and team building involved in their process for a very small number of companies each year. This number can actually go down as partners saturate the number of board seats and operating roles that they can reasonably hold. Simply put, this model doesn’t have the intrinsic network effects of the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem.
 The second crucial drawback is that scientists and engineers—the crucial value generators in high-tech innovation—aren’t in charge of their destiny. In tech, founders are in control of their cap table. YC companies are coached to only sell a small fraction of their company to investors early on. In biotech venture creation, VC funds take the lion’s share of equity from the start. It can be a bit like the difficult negotiation [ https://substack.com/redirect/4823331c-8f98-4bd6-9060-e7aff67e6bd8?r=o1saq ] in Bad Santa, where Willie and Marcus end up giving half of their profits away to their new business partner Gin.
"
66_28,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"But the numbers can actually be even more dramatic. We’re not talking about giving up half of the equity, we’re talking about a scenario where key founding scientists can receive single digit equity percentages, if they even receive any equity at all. In a world where their work can create billions of dollars of value, many biotechnologists are capturing miniscule fractions of these returns.
"
66_29,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,The problem here isn’t just financial.
66_30,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,Ownership has an important consequence: control over the direction of a company. A central component of venture creation is the process of building out a management team of executives who have experience bringing drugs to market. This means that scientists and engineers often don’t steer the trajectory of new companies. Leave it to the professionals!
66_31,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"While this can be effective for executing within an existing paradigm, it doesn’t forge new ones. Google and Facebook weren’t built by former IBM executives, they were built by young programmers exploring totally different approaches to technology development and company culture. In the aftermath, we now have an existence proof for the fact that young engineers can build and lead massive generational companies.

66_34,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"Since making their first biotech investment in Ginkgo Bioworks (read more about that story here [ https://substack.com/redirect/5fb4bd34-1f5d-4610-99c1-c000f51d258f?r=o1saq ]), YC now funds more biotech startups [ https://substack.com/redirect/7e52aa89-9feb-4438-a0b9-9e771fecc1ec?r=o1saq ] each year than any other investor—giving scientists a totally different option compared to the venture creation route. The software powerhouse a16z has raised several massive biotech funds, and their partners have been vocal proponents [ https://substack.com/redirect/c9fec2f6-d003-4291-9779-52dedeca21ca?r=o1saq ] of giving scientists the reins to their own companies.

66_35,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"This trend is often referred to as the founder-led biotech movement.
 Founder-led companies are beginning to make a real mark on the industry."
66_36,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"The investor Tony Kulesa framed this beautifully in a recent essay [ https://substack.com/redirect/093ca635-548c-453e-8c58-57d5c146b648?r=o1saq ], saying:
“In the past 12 months, Ginkgo Bioworks, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, AbCellera, Finch Therapeutics, SQZ Biotech — all founded and led by technical founders fresh from their academic roots — have gone public. Hot on their heels, founder-led startups at the Series A and beyond like Asimov, Biobot Analytics, Cellino, Dyno Therapeutics, GRO Biosciences, PathAI, Strand Therapeutics, Vedanta, 1910 Genetics, and many others, have raised hundreds of millions of venture capital to work on some of the most innovative frontiers in the industry."
66_37,1661173102,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Techbio Taxonomy,"The founders of these companies are hungry and creative scientists that realized the impact of their work before others did, and now they are leading the charge to bring their innovations to the world.”
 This general shift in the biotech VC ecosystem isn’t limited to just a smaller subset of anomalous companies. As the blood bath in public markets has dropped the number of biotech IPOs, emerging techbio funds have actually overtaken more traditional biotech funds at the Series A stage:
Beyond seed and series A investments, late-stage investors have also signaled a willingness to finance founder-led biotechs. Over time, this pipeline should only become more robust as some of the companies become massively successful. All of these changes have the potential to open the floodgates for a techbio revolution where company creation is accelerated, capital is more evenly distributed across more companies, and scientists are able to bring incredible new technologies out of their labs and into the market with less friction.
 Here, the key take home message is that one central component of techbio actually has nothing to do with AI, software, or robots: one of the major changes is the adoption of the tech investment and company creation model where founders are at the helm.
 To learn how techbio companies are deeply integrated, backed by new services, and potentially massive, with real examples…

in St.Gallen.

 Please excuse my persistence, but since your participation would definitely
be a highlight for our entire audience of future founders, would a virtual
talk (15-20') or fireside chat (25') be possible? Based on our experience
with last year's online conference, your time commitment would be minimal.
 Also, we are still in the early stages of our agenda planning and could
offer you a timeslot that best fits your schedule.

 Nevertheless, I wish you all the best for the year ahead, and I would be
happy to stay connected regarding START Summit 2023 (23.-24.3.2023).

 Best regards from Switzerland,

SWEATING IT OUTPELOTON SLASHES 500 MORE JOBS AS IT RACES TO RETURN TO GROWTH
This week, Peloton announced that it's cutting another 500 jobs in a move that CEO Barry McCarthy said should position the struggling fitness equipment maker to return to growth. 
 The cuts, which amount to about 12% of Peloton’s workforce, mark a pivot point for the company, McCarthy told CNBC on Thursday. Peloton already has had multiple rounds of layoffs this year. "

 McCarthy took over as CEO of Peloton earlier this year from co-founder John Foley, and has overseen drastic changes to its business model as the company struggled after a sales boom earlier in the Covid pandemic. A former Spotify and Netflix executive, he has pushed the company’s business further into subscriptions while broadening the availability of its products beyond Peloton’s direct-to-consumer roots.  Earlier this week, the two-time Disruptor 50 company said it would put its bikes in every Hilton-branded hotel in the United States. It recently announced partnerships to sell equipment in Dick’s Sporting Goods stores and on Amazon. "

 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
LOOKING BACK AT THE INAUGURAL LIST, 10 YEARS LATER..."
83_10,1665088450,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Another hill to climb?,"THIS WEEK: KABAM
Amid the popularity of free-to-play, downloadable games and gaming platforms like “Fortnite,” “League of Legends,” and Roblox, it’s become extremely rare that a high-profile video game is released now without some sort of recurring payment strategy — a far cry from the typical $60 standalone game purchase that dominated the video game industry as recently as less than a decade ago.  But as video games have shifted away from solely console-based experiences to more digital- and mobile-driven platforms, the business model and how gamers interact with the games they play have significantly shifted as well. 
 “In 2013, it was very controversial to say that the free-to-play business model would be the next major dominant model within all of gaming,” said Kevin Chou, the co-founder and former CEO of mobile gaming company Kabam. “Mobile games [then] were pretty much free-to-play games, but we were saying, ‘You know, it’s not just mobile games, but gaming, in general, is going to move in that direction.’"
83_11,1665088450,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Another hill to climb?,"” In-game purchases were a nascent business for most console and PC games, but the success of social games like FarmVille showed the potential. 
 Kabam, which was named to the inaugural CNBC Disruptor 50 list in 2013, had initially evolved from developing free-to-play games for Facebook to creating first- and third-party games for social, web, and mobile platforms. Like what Fortnite has found success with, Kabam leaned into well-known properties, creating games around movie franchises like “The Hobbit” and “Fast & Furious.”  But while these games are considered free-to-play, as it turns out, there is a very lucrative side to them.

Several multi-year Disruptor 50 companies fit this bill, including Didi Chuxing, Grab and Gojek — all of which have gone public in recent years.  A ""super app"" describes an app that often acts as a one-stop shop for all your mobile needs."
83_14,1665088450,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Another hill to climb?,"For example, you might order a taxi or food via the app and at the same time do payments and messaging. This eliminates the need to have multiple apps for different functions."

https://digitalfestival.ch/

Welches sind die Erfolgsfaktoren eines D2C-Unternehmens? Lassen sich monotone TÃ¤tigkeiten per Knopfdruck erledigen? Und wie verwandelt man die IT-Welt in einen geschlechtergerechten Arbeitsort? In unserer Keynote mit Luca Michas vom FoodTech-Startup yamo und in verschiedenen Labs gehen wir diesen Fragen nach, geben Antworten und diskutieren LÃ¶sungswege.
 ERFOLGSFAKTOREN FÃœR D2C-UNTERNEHMEN

Luca Michas hat das FoodTech-Startup yamo mitgegrÃ¼ndet, um frische, biologische und nachhaltige Lebensmittel fÃ¼r Babys und Kleinkinder herzustellen. Yamo mÃ¶chte Eltern in ganz Europa dabei unterstÃ¼tzen, ihre Kinder gesund zu erziehen und ein Bewusstsein fÃ¼r nachhaltige ErnÃ¤hrung zu entwickeln. Umso wichtiger ist der Aufbau von Direct-to-Consumer-Funktionen und die Frage nach den Erfolgsfaktoren eines D2C-GeschÃ¤ftsmodells. In dieser Keynote teilt Luca Michas seine Erfahrungen und gibt wichtige Insights. Lass dir das nicht entgehen.

YOU HATE IT? LET'S AUTOMATE IT!

 Je monotoner die TÃ¤tigkeit, desto demotivieren-der und fehleranfÃ¤lliger ist sie. Dennoch mÃ¼ssen QualitÃ¤tsmerkmale wie Sicherheit, FlexibilitÃ¤t und Compliance auf hohem Level gewÃ¤hrleistet werden. Wie das geht? Mauricio de Sousa (CEO & Co-Founder) und Marcel Altmann (Manager Automation & Digitization) von Rewion inspirieren und diskutieren mit dir, wie die digitale Revolution im BÃ¼roalltag Prozesse verschlanken und repetitive TÃ¤tigkeiten auf Knopfdruck erledigen kann. Hol dir persÃ¶nliche Tipps, wie du in der VUCA-Welt ein erfÃ¼lltes Arbeitsleben fÃ¼hren kannst.

IMMERSIVE DESIGN LAB

In der Zukunft werden GebÃ¤ude mit Hilfe erweiterter RealitÃ¤t und kÃ¼nstlicher Intelligenz entworfen und geplant. DafÃ¼r braucht es kollaborative Plattformen wie zum Beispiel das Immersive Design Lab (IDL), ein interdisziplinÃ¤res Labor der ETH ZÃ¼rich. Romana Rust (Senior Researcher), Michael Kraus (Senior Researcher) und Daniela Mitterberger (PhD Researcher) nehmen dich mit in eine virtuelle Welt, lassen dich rÃ¤umliches Audio hÃ¶ren und Augmented-Reality-Umgebungen erleben. Sei dabei und staune Ã¼ber die MÃ¶glichkeiten der Zukunft.

BRING WOMEN BACK TO WORK

Im Zuge der Pandemiebedingten VerÃ¤nderungen der Arbeitswelt, verÃ¤ndert sich auch das Gesicht der IT-Workforce bei Merkle. Vielfalt und Integration sind in den Fokus getreten sowie die StÃ¤rkung der Rolle der Frau. Ziel ist es, aus der  IT-Welt einen geschlechtergerechten Arbeitsort zu machen. Athena Blatsioti (BWBW Partner Relationship Manager) und Tamara Ambrosini (Salesforce Solutions & Marketing Partnership Director) von Merkle zeigen dir an Hand konkreter Beispiele und Praktiken, wie sie das Â«Bring Women Back to WorkÂ» Programm bei Merkle integriert haben und es aktiv unterstÃ¼tzen. Lass dir dieses hochaktuelle Thema nicht entgehen und profitiere von Expertinnenwissen.

INNOVATION VS."
92_1,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,INFLATIONRECAPPING THE DISRUPTOR 50 DINNERAre we at the beginning of another roaring Twenties?
92_2,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,Or will the fight to tame inflation also stifle innovation?  
92_3,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"That was one of the subjects of a wide-ranging discussion at last night’s Disruptor 50 Dinner, which took place on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Founders and CEOs from 2022 Disruptor 50 companies, venture investors, and members of the Disruptor 50 Advisory Board came together for a special evening led by CNBC’s Julia Boorstin and Mike Santoli. 
 Santoli kicked off the conversation, held under Chatham House Rules, by giving his assessment of the closed IPO “window” for most fast-growing, venture-backed startups. The sharp slowdown in IPOs comes at a time when many of the companies to make their public debut in 2021 have seen their stock prices beaten down far below their IPO levels, as investors ran away from parts of the market seen as higher risk. And with the Federal Reserve raising rates again this week, the exodus continued."
92_4,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"When asked what this means for the startups that are still private, one of the VCs at the table said it means companies in hypergrowth mode should slow down."
92_5,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"“If growth is no longer valued, then why grow so quickly?"
92_6,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"You can slow down, stop spending so much.”  
That brought out the argument from one of the other attendees that maybe the Federal Reserve’s mission to stop inflation will also stifle innovation. The guest compared the current environment to the post-World War I environment, which also happened to occur after a deadly global pandemic. The result of the war and the pandemic was the “Roaring Twenties” – an incredible period of technological and cultural innovation.   “But,” they said, “if the Fed stomps out all that in the name of stomping out inflation, we could miss out on another innovative wave that is born out of people emerging from years of isolation and restriction.” 
 Another reason the 2020s might be different from the 1920s is the persistence of work from home. By a show of hands, not a single person around the dinner table said they or their companies were mandating its workers to be in the office five days a week, potentially posing another threat to innovation.   “And we haven’t yet felt the impact of the two years people spent working from home exclusively,” said one of the Disruptor 50 company founders. “Just like we haven’t yet fully understood the damage done to kids who spent a year or more in remote school, the same is true for workers. Yes, we got productivity but we didn’t get innovation. Innovation comes when people work together. In person.” 
 On the other hand, innovation is human nature, and the entrepreneurs who become leaders of companies that end up on the Disruptor 50 List can’t help but look for ways to harness technology to drive continuous change – in any economy.

By 2013, when Microseismic was selected for the inaugural CNBC Disruptor 50 list, it was pretty far from the ""start"" in startup, already in its tenth year as a company. And that preceding decade had been one during which the company, which performs subsurface monitoring using passive seismic technology, had grown up amid the boom in U.S. oilfield hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, and which by 2013, was about to go bust in a major way.
 
 When the company and its founder and CEO Peter Duncan had first raised money from investors in 2003, the idea wasn't to ride the shale boom. Helping energy companies perform environmentally sensitive geological exploration was a core focus, with its approach more like a stethoscope, Duncan says, compared to the conventional technology of the time, seismic vibrators, which he says worked more like an ultrasound. But of all the things the company put on the list of uses for its seismic technology when it was raising money, ""frac monitoring was at the bottom,"" Duncan said."
92_10,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"""We're not going to do that,"" he recalls saying."
92_11,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"""A big red X."" 
 For one, there were other players already in the market, and the dominant oil services companies, including Halliburton and Baker Hughes, were buying up firms doing science similar to Microseismic – Halliburton already owned seismic mapping company Pinnacle Technologies.  And in a way, Duncan thought the science wasn't a good match for the blunt process of oil and gas drilling. ""You drill a wellbore to produce oil and gas, not to put fancy science experiments down,"" he said. "
92_12,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"But the shale gas boom, and the market, sent a different message. ""They told us to do frac monitoring, and it became more valuable to clients as they started drilling long horizontal wells that could no longer be sensed or monitored with a single down hole,"" Duncan said, and Microseismic was building the equivalent of a big dish microphone up on the surface."
92_13,1663963513,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Is inflation stifling innovation?,"Its approach made Microseismic a dominant force in frac monitoring services – for a time.

 Isaacman, who founded payments company Shift4 and flew on the first private SpaceX flight to orbit last year, is deep into training with his team for the first spaceflight of the Polaris Program, announced earlier this year, in partnership with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Isaacman’s crew of four is using fighter jets — including aircraft from his personal fleet — to prepare for flying to orbit on the first mission, called Polaris Dawn.
  “We can’t go to space very often [and there] is a lot of planning that goes into a mission,” Isaacman told CNBC’s Morgan Brennan at an airfield in Bozeman, Montana.  “We want to use as much time leading up to [the launch] for training as possible,” Isaacman said, adding that “using fighter aircraft is a great analog” to spaceflight. It follows a practice that NASA uses with its own astronaut corps. 
 While Polaris Dawn was initially planned for the fourth quarter of 2022, Isaacman said the mission launch is expected to occur “early next year.” Its the first of up to three missions, with the final one expected to be the first crewed launch of SpaceX’s Starship rocket. 
 Isaacman outlined the program’s three objectives: Go to the highest orbit around Earth that humans have ever flown, conduct a spacewalk outside of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule and use Starlink internet satellites to communicate. He also said roughly 40 science and research payloads will fly on the mission."

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?LOOKING BACK AT THE INAUGURAL LIST, 10 YEARS LATER... THIS WEEK: OPOWERBefore Alex Laskey launched an energy efficiency company in 2007, he was primarily working on political campaigns, ""almost exclusively losing campaigns,"" he told CNBC in a phone conversation in June.  Towards the end of his early run in politics, in 2006, Laskey worked in public opinion research and political polling about voter sentiment on, mostly, environmental and energy issues, and that work catalyzed Laskey's awareness of and sense of urgent desire to respond to climate change.  The political opinion polling also taught Laskey that while ""climate change"" was a highly politicized issue in 2006 (and still is, according to Pew Research Center), that even back in 2006, almost all American voters agreed with the idea of ""saving energy"" and not being wasteful, Laskey told CNBC. 
 As these learnings were percolating for Laskey, he reconnected with his college friend Dan Yates, who had in 2004 sold his education software company Edusoft to Houghton Mifflin for $40 million."
93_16,1657832778,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Could the IPO market stay frozen into 2023?,"The two decided to work together on an effort related to the environment and responding to climate change. In January 2007, Laskey and Yates committed to spend a few months testing out some ideas and seeing how compatible they would be working together. 
 The startup that Laskey and Yates would go on to launch was Opower, which shared energy efficiency recommendations with customers through the utility companies that serve them. In 2014, the energy efficiency company went public. Two years later, it was acquired for $532 million by software giant Oracle. Today, Opower is still operating within Oracle as a part of its utilities-focused business, and is still being run by an early hire, Matt O'Keefe.

 ONE MORE THING...
 THIS CRYPTO DOWNTURN IS UNLIKE ANY BEFOREThe two words on every crypto investor’s lips right now are undoubtedly “crypto winter.” 
 Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of a massive rally in 2021.  Bitcoin, the world’s biggest digital coin, is off 70% from a November all-time high of nearly $69,000. 
 That’s resulted in many experts warning of a prolonged bear market known as “crypto winter.” The last such event occurred between 2017 and 2018.

A 3-step guide to building in the inbox - inspired by The Hustle via Mailmodo
[https://tracker.mailmodo.email/clicks/plain/0fe3dc21-2c91-4968-b432-506ee51bf13b/38c56301-d89c-53df-b62c-aa5838aafaf4/5899f07a-304d-55d9-86b6-ee22788187e2]

1. Activate the ""prospects-to-subscribers-to-ambassadors"" funnel

The first subscribers of The Hustle's email lists were the speakers from The
Hustle Con. In 2015, Sam was looking for a new business and then gave Hustle Con
a try - it was supposed to be a TedTalk for entrepreneurs where each of them got
a 15-minute slot to speak about their journey.

 

 To promote this, Sam started an email newsletter that spoke of these speakers'
entrepreneurial stories, and bam! all the speakers not only subscribed but also
shared the newsletter in their network. 🤯

 

What triggered this positive response was a simple fact - the newsletter was
about the subscribers. This motivated them to take an interest and spread the
word about it! Ultimately, these first subscribers unknowingly became The
Hustle's first ambassadors and gave it the initial traction."

the subscribers received access to a private online community, free swag, and

 2. Find your voice 🔊

 

Be it growth tips or email marketing hacks, there're plenty of newsletters
discussing every aspect of marketing already. What is missing is your unique
experience and perspective. 🎯

 

Tbh, The Hustle doesn't do anything radically different from any of its
contemporaries. Yet, they created a niche by simplifying business news, adding
their perspective, and ditching jargons. Soon, this style became their
identity."

3. Go back to the basics 🙃

 

The Hustle registers 2 times better metrics than the cross-industry average. In
2018, they had been consistently maintaining an open rate of 40% compared to the
industry average of 22%.

 

 This performance is not just because of their breakthrough ideas or interesting
email copy. Sam Parr and the team have always been particular about getting
deliverability right and following the best practices to optimize performance.

Snowflake was the first widely adopted cloud data platform which separated storage and computation. This gave users the ability to quickly switch between small, medium, and large data warehouses. It also provided a very familiar standard data warehouse “feel.”
 The ability to separate computation and storage allows database software to increase:
Availability.
 Scalability for compute and storage.
 Reduces Costs.

Data Processing Engines
Presto/Trino. Presto [ https://substack.com/redirect/61c06d19-76b4-4f62-85a9-3ebf34a73739?r=o1saq ] was developed at Facebook as an open-source distributed query engine which supports much of the SQL analytics workload at Facebook. Presto’s Connector API allows plugins to provide a high performance I/O interface to dozens of data sources, including Hadoop data warehouses, RDBMSs, NoSQL systems, and stream processing systems.
"
98_15,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"What is interesting to know about Presto is that, due to some legal complications, its original founders were forced to branch off of Presto’s initial open-source project and develop what is now called Trino. The founders reveal more about this split in the recently published article, Why leaving Facebook/Meta was the best thing we could do for the Trino Community [ https://substack.com/redirect/79dd45ef-1895-48e0-b58e-39ea39bbf6b4?r=o1saq ].
Spark. Apache Spark started in 2009 as a research project at UC Berkeley's AMPLab. You can read more about it in the paper, ""Spark: Cluster Computing with Working Sets.” Sparks' goal was to balance the fault tolerance and scalability of Hadoop Map Reduce, while providing the ability to reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations."

Airflow is currently one of the more popular available orchestrators. It was developed by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb as a solution for the problem [ https://substack.com/redirect/44244e18-0e06-4cd1-a358-bc49feddd8ab?r=o1saq ] of always being one generation behind the needs of users with workflow orchestration tools. Airflow was written to be “configuration as code,” using Python as its language of choice. Thanks to what I consider a relatively straightforward approach to defining DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) and the tasks within them, as well as the fact that Airflow is open source, Airflow was quickly adopted.
 Prefect is also a Python-based orchestration tool."
98_19,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"Unlike Airflow which involves a little more of a learning curve in terms of understanding how DAGs are created, Prefect is much more Pythonic."
98_20,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"Meaning it is written as if you were writing Python code. It also has built-in workflow version control and is far easier to test compared to Airflow. It’s often hard to discuss Prefect without referring to Airflow, as part of the reason it was developed was to improve on some of Airflow’s limitations.

"
98_26,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"Data engineering has changed a lot during the past few decades. Prior to 2010, you probably would not have come across the term."
98_27,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"Perhaps you heard of DBA or ETL developers, but somewhere around the turn of the millennium data scientist was popularized and so was data engineering.
 Specialization of Analytics Engineering - Even in the past decade a lot has changed. The title of analytics engineer was developed and popularized as a role which can help offload a lot of the work data engineers did on the analytics side of work.
 Real-Time Is Becoming Easier - Besides the increasing specialization of data engineering and analytics engineering, we are also seeing the ability to approach problems such as streaming with much more robust and easier to manage tools.
 So, the potential of real-time data analytics is becoming more feasible for a broader range of companies. This could have an impact on some other layers of data engineering work such as reducing the amount of batch processing required. It also would require a lot of buy-in from those who understand the batch processing paradigm, which will likely be a much larger hurdle.
 Treating data as a product vs as a pure IT function - Another trend is treating data more like a product. This aligns with the data mesh [ https://substack.com/redirect/212969a1-cd0c-40a1-98c1-143b8c96742e?r=o1saq ] paradigm which has been gaining traction in the past 2-3 years. With this mentality, rather than having a strong centralized data team, data teams often work on specific nodes which are generally attached to a domain."
98_28,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"Essentially, these are “microservices” for data."
98_29,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"With this approach, the goal is to take data from merely being an operational byproduct, to a purposely developed feature which can be used to build further applications and values.
 Renaissance of Best Practices - Another trend being rekindled is that of best practices. For example, the head of data at Convoy, Chad Sanderson, has written several posts regarding the importance of data modeling [ https://substack.com/redirect/7e2e8618-13ca-472a-b212-b2d6159e6a5d?r=o1saq ] and how much it has been neglected in the past 3-5 years. He, along with several other data experts, are leading the charge to once again make data modeling important.
 In the end, data engineering is going through a lot of changes, many of which have been driven by increasing demands for data, but also changing application design paradigms.
 3. Getting into Data Engineering as a Software Engineer
It’s not uncommon for me to be asked by software engineers or IT specialists,
“How do I break into data engineering?”
 Software engineers often have a solid foundation to transition into data engineering. If you’ve been programming and developing software for the past few years, you should already be familiar with languages such as Python and have a baseline in SQL. There are a few key areas I have noticed software engineers usually either need to learn about, or polish up on. In particular, to do with the fact that you’re now dealing with billions of rows, not a single transaction-worth of data."
98_30,1664301293,pragmaticengineer@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What is Data Engineering: Part 2,"It’s the OLTP vs OLAP paradigm switch.
 In turn, most software engineers need to improve or dig into:
Data warehouses / data lakes / data modeling.

 Software engineers actually produce the application that’s used by end-users and data scientists and analysts provide valuable insights and models which can increase revenues and decrease costs.

All the business applications and internal systems are messy and hard to truly approach.

 There have been a lot of changes in the data engineering world, even in the last few years, so I will avoid any bombastic predictions.

I personally find it refreshing to have a system for thinking about data engineering terms and the tools which we hear lots about, just from being in the tech industry – such as about Snowflake or Databricks.
 Several software engineer friends of mine have made the leap to transition into data engineering in the past few years, and most whom I’ve talked with have been happy with their decision. Some mentioned the same downsides which Ben summed up: data engineering is a new field, businesses often don’t fully understand it, and career paths can feel limited in some ways.
 What is certain is that every business has more data and they want to put that data to good use. As a well-rounded software engineer, understanding how to work with these large data sets is the least we should do. And, given the opportunity, it could be a great challenge to get your hands dirty by building data engineering solutions.

 So, in this edition of The Mailmodo Bulletin, we’ll discuss how emails helped us
get 500+ referrals within 3 weeks! 
 

 But before that, let’s help you sign up for the masterclass that we’ve been
talking about🕵️

Now, let's begin! 🍴

How we used emails for our viral referral campaign via Mailmodo
[https://tracker.mailmodo.email/clicks/plain/b2094686-5d43-474f-9303-7197e814e653/674120cc-8ad6-5b95-b2b6-b0d744b68c7d/5899f07a-304d-55d9-86b6-ee22788187e2]

1. We used emails to keep users engaged in the viral loop

Once we were sure we wanted a referral campaign, we realized that we'd also need
a viral loop (quite literally), and we came up with this plan - 

 

 * To get the masterclass for free, the participant must be in the top 50 rank
   holders of the waitlist.
  * To move up the ranks, the participant needs to refer more people.

 Everything is fun and games here until you remember how easy it is for people to
forget about a campaign after referring one person and the viral loop falls
flat."

We decided to start a weekly email sequence and remind the participants about
their rank and how they can move up by referring more of their friends."
117_7,1664534035,hello@email.mailmodo.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?UTF-8?Q?Going_viral_in_the_inbox____=F0=9F=9A=80?=," 

 Below is a snapshot of one of those reminder campaigns 👇

These reminder emails had more than 40% and 20% open as well as click rates.

emails to nurture these leads, our referrals campaign would’ve been a dud.

 

 Our top tips for using emails to keep referrers engaged

 

 * Send emails to remind referrers of the ongoing competition
 * Create an email nurture flow to introduce referrers to your other resources
   related to the topic of your campaign."
117_10,1664534035,hello@email.mailmodo.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?UTF-8?Q?Going_viral_in_the_inbox____=F0=9F=9A=80?=," 
  * Send emails focusing on incentives and special offers to motivate referrers,
   etc. . 

 2. Leverage interactivity to shorten the journey

 

Most referral emails nudge the recipients to go to a link and then refer
somebody, but we decided to go the interactive way. We knew that AMP could make
almost anything happen inside an email, so we went ahead and did exactly that."
117_11,1664534035,hello@email.mailmodo.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?UTF-8?Q?Going_viral_in_the_inbox____=F0=9F=9A=80?=,"Instead of automating the reminder emails via viral loops, we created a “Refer a
friend” AMP widget on the Mailmodo editor and enabled users to refer a friend
without leaving their inbox. The result spoke for itself. This is how the block
works 👇

Image
[https://res.cloudinary.com/mailmodo/image/upload/v1664528196/editor/p/61f9f348-2323-438e-86d3-0894f12d4309/358f6b49fffcfb5179bce054a3f1f9d7_uydqyr.gif]

Right after someone referred a friend with this block, their friend would
automatically get an email informing them of the referral. This entire process
helped us in reducing one step from the entire user journey and helped us get
better response.

 Our takeaway

If your users can complete an action in 2 steps, why make them take another?

 After the success of the referral campaign to get people on the waitlist, we
launched another referral campaign once the course was launched. According to
this, you can buy the course for $49 or get it for free by referring your
friends."
117_13,1664534035,hello@email.mailmodo.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?UTF-8?Q?Going_viral_in_the_inbox____=F0=9F=9A=80?=,"However, the free access kicks in only if the referred friend signs up for the
course. After a week, we realized that this condition was leading to attrition
of high-intent users who spent some time sharing their information and entering
one more email ID. 
 

 So, we used Zapier and triggered an email to send them free access 24 hours
later after they refer a friend whether this referred friend signs up or not
(tongue twister much? 😁). 

 

 This way, our referral count keeps increasing, and our high-intent users also
enroll without any dependencies. 

 Uptill now, we've sent more than 60 such emails with an open rate of more than
30%.

As any capitalist knows, when diagnosing the poor performance of a company (but I suspect there are parallels to a country as well), we would not only dig into the performance of the CEO (or in this case, President), but also senior management, their direct reports, departmental wins and losses, and how adaptable they have been in fixing errors and course correcting.
 Even more telling is how the CEO holds their team accountable and makes changes in strategy and/or personnel when the data supports it.

We can probably also safely presume that the President of the United States has access to some of the most talented and qualified individuals in America. But, if miscast in the wrong role, even the most qualified people become instantly unqualified.
 Put another way, would you hire a veterinarian, even the best in the world, to do a human heart transplant? How about a plumber to run a battery company? Or an elementary school teacher to be the next Fed chair?
 The obvious answer is no."

Innocence of profits, payrolls and competition seems to count as a virtue among today’s progressives."

Presidents are free to appoint whoever they wish, but the results of business ignorance in this Administration are speaking for themselves.
 More blunty, why would we hand the controls to the biggest and most important economy in the world, especially during an unprecedented and pernicious convergence of inflation and slowing growth, to people who wouldn’t even be considered an Associate at most Wall Street firms?
 And while leadership should be held accountable, often the real work happens across the middle layers of management where decisions about strategy, tactics, and execution are made on a daily basis.
 For example, a board of directors would reasonably demand clarity on how we’ve been managing the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ongoing implications (which I wrote about last week [https://substack.com/redirect/1e05c476-08a1-4d00-874c-937f27b5b40f?u@394114]), and the path forward that is in the best interests of all Americans.
 With record inflation, a worsening mental health crisis, mass shootings, and the rollback of individual rights like Roe v. Wade, is now the time to continue to be the first line of defense for other countries around the world? Or should we reprioritize our focus on domestic progress and the issues Americans care about most (see Q7 in this recent Monmouth poll [https://substack.com/redirect/cc7995ec-6940-436d-9eb6-3a1e5305ebcd?u@394114]).
 As we approach the midterms, Biden has some important decisions to make that may end up being critical to his presidency (and ultimately whether or not the Dems stay in office). The board has officially put their CEO on notice, and unless he shows improvement, the board’s confidence will only continue to wane. In sports terms, it may not be time to fire the GM, but it’s probably time to think about a new coaching staff and adding the right players to fill the team’s most gaping holes.
 With the right pieces in place, then and only then can the team craft and execute a cohesive and practical strategy. And just like a company, hopefully those results will speak for themselves. But that doesn’t discount the efforts of a competent communications/IR team to communicate their performance in a compelling way to shareholders (read voters) as well.
 If the past few weeks have been any indication, it’s that American voters (its board of directors) aren’t stupid. They’re frustrated that we are falling behind on big issues."

Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US
View image: ( https://media.beehiiv.net/uploads/asset/file/ba81d1cd-39d8-4220-8aaa-7a3405302ac5/image.png )
Last week, Pinduoduo launchedÂ Temu ( https://temu.com/ ), its new US ecommerce platform. My initial reaction: it feels like someone combinedÂ SHEIN ( https://shein.com/ ) and Wish ( https://www.wish.com/ )Â into one.
 I firstÂ wrote ( https://www.thespl.it/p/pinduoduo-plans-us-launch ) about the yet-to-be-named Temu a few weeks ago and Pinduoduo more broadly ( https://turner.substack.com/p/pinduoduo-and-vertically-integrated )Â in August 2020Â (check out both for more context)."
124_5,1663108061,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US,"I thought we'd see Temu leverage PDD's base of Chinese merchants, which it seems to be doing. I also thought it may emulate SHEIN's clothing / beauty catalog, which its doing as well. One thing I did not predict was the product assortment matching the random electronics and household goods (and I mean truly random) you'd find on Wish, but maybe that's just my fault for not knowing PDD's merchant base well.
"
124_6,1663108061,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US,"Temu is currently offering 30%-off sitewide, which compares to SHEIN's 10% to 20% depending on order sizes (up to $169). There's 30 to 75 ""free ( https://us.temu.com/w/bglp_all_new_free_goods.html?_bg_sbs=1&_bg_fs=1&_x_vst_scene­g&_p_from=newbie&refer_page_name=home&refer_page_id005_1662924805495_4wa8adqodm&refer_page_sn005 )"" $0.01 items that appear to rotate daily, which you can't view unless you create an account or share your phone number. Â Currently, Temu offers 10 to 12 day shipping and a ""full refund, keep the item"" guarantee if an order arrives late. It also includes carbon offsets on every delivery, though its unclear exactly how.

The early App Store and product reviews are clearly fake. Baby toys haveÂ ""outfit fits great"" comments, and many of the day one App Store reviews commented on the fast shipping, despite it having just launched. As of today, no one I know who purchased on launch day has received an order yet.
 On mobile web, Temu heavily emphasizes downloading the app (download it yourselfÂ here ( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/temu-team-up-price-down/id1641486558 ))."

124_9,1663108061,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US,"The app's core product is a endless feed of shoppable pictures, contrasted to SHEIN whose homepage focuses more on broad product categories to be tapped on to browse products.

"
124_20,1663108061,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US,"My two highest level takeaways are:
Â· Temu seems to be leveraging Pinduoduo's merchant base

Â· An endless feed sets up for an ad-based business model, again similar to PDD

Wish has a similar product catalog, but it's business model that was built almost entirely on top of Facebook's ad platform collapsed after Apple's ATT changes last summer. It feels like there's an opportunity to fill that gap in the market. As I mentioned two weeks ago, Pinduoduo increasing its existing merchants volumes by helping them expanding outside China all on one back-end platform could allow Temu to offer sustainably lower prices to consumers over time. This existing merchant base would also help it quickly scale its supply to match consumer demand if Temu grows fast.
 Temu's free returns may help offset product quality concerns, as Wish was notorious for having very low long-term repurchase rates, often due to products not even arriving. Repurchase rates may be why Temu chose to focus on fashion and apparel, as SHEIN had a 30% repurchase rate ( https://kr-asia.com/decoding-shein-all-the-world-over-part-3-of-3 ) (in 2018) and sees roughly 60% of the app install base open the app monthly (per App Annie). Pinduoduo's ""Consumer to Manufacturer"" model could be compared to the ""data-driven manufacturing"" approach SHEIN is known for. And if I had to guess, the Temu app is built with the intention of layering on more product categories over time and monetizing the feed with an ad product like Pinduoduo in China.
"
124_21,1663108061,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Pinduoduo's Temu Launches in the US,My biggest outstanding questions are around Temu's go-to-market strategy. There's early indications of leveraging messaging for customer acquisition like Pinduoduo.

There's also no hints yet around what a Temu influencer marketing strategy could look like, which I think makes even more sense in the current environment after Apple's ATT changes. Its also possible giving things away for one cent is all Temu needs to do to go viral."

TikTok has 11x more total time spent than Reels: Instagram users spend a total of 17.6 million hours per day watching Reels, compared to TikTok's 197.8 million hours. Reels engagement fell 13.6% in August, and it makes up only 20% of total time spent on Instagram. Only 20% of Meta's 11 million US creators are posting Reels, and 33% of Reels videos are created on another platform, usually TikTok.

In February of 2022, the Texas Teacher’s Pension fund sent an open letter to their asset manager, Blackrock, demanding they cease all discussion of divestment. While Blackrock bent over backwards [ https://substack.com/redirect/4984c802-3ffb-45a6-b5d4-a65ff424d041?r=o1saq ] to assure them of its long term commitment to fossil fuels, it was no use. Republican state legislatures across the country saw an opportunity."
127_7,1664304014,myclimatejourney@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Polarization has finally reached Wall Street: The climate threat --  and opportunity,"Texas may have gone the farthest, banning any state funds [ https://substack.com/redirect/be089d6f-4438-4c8e-adbf-9442d6645c77?r=o1saq ] to be managed by banks or investment firms that have ESG offerings. 
"
127_8,1664304014,myclimatejourney@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Polarization has finally reached Wall Street: The climate threat --  and opportunity,"Then, in August the DRLL ETF [ https://substack.com/redirect/d328881f-cc17-477c-9f75-1c5e9bfe67d7?r=o1saq ] came out. Launched by the author of Woke, inc [ https://substack.com/redirect/afae5312-5935-44f2-b942-75face1550ec?r=o1saq ], it is almost identical to a generic US energy index fund, but has an explicit mandate to pressure those companies to: drill baby, drill. Even though it costs >4x more than the equivalent index fund (.41% compared to .10% for XLE), it has taken off, growing from $27m in holdings on its launch to over $320m (as of September 21st). 
 It has been one of fastest growing new ETFs ever.  
 What’s at Stake
On first take, the success of the right’s backlash here is not good news. It relieves pressure upon major Wall Street organizations to take science-aligned climate actions by giving them the excuse of another constituency to appease. And, like Trump railing against electric cars in a recent rally, it deepens the narrative that climate actions are something only for liberals. 
 If half of investors are calling for the divestment from fossil fuels and reinvestment into climate solutions, and the other half are buying oil companies to mandate them to drill, we’ll be unlikely to bring down global emissions in time. 
 The Truth Anti-ESG Investing Is About to Face
While polarization has now entered finance, the industry itself is far from polarized."

127_17,1664304014,myclimatejourney@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Polarization has finally reached Wall Street: The climate threat --  and opportunity,"For decades the narratives that “fossil fuels are a necessary investment for competitive performance” and that “green investing underperforms, so should only be undertaken as an act of charity” have been pervasive, making fiduciary investors nervous about adopting them in endowments and 401(k) portfolios. 
 But the Anti-ESG crowd has thrown out fiduciary logic by arguing that values can be incorporated into financial and investment decisions. Texas’ anti-ESG law has reduced the number of investment firms it can work with. This lower competition is modeled to cost the state over $500 million in higher fees [ https://substack.com/redirect/c937ca2e-5ea7-4097-a632-398786d2d9d8?r=o1saq ]. 
 This opens the door for a new sweep of legal challenges to the fiduciary duty and creates an opportunity to shed light on the underperformance of 401(k) fossil fuel positions. The S&P 500 Energy index has had a 0.78% return over the last 10 years as of September 14th, 2022 [ https://substack.com/redirect/200dc758-8fdc-4b14-90ec-50a56abea5e5?r=o1saq ] compared to the broader S&P 500 which gained 10.42% annually for the last 10 years as of September 14th, 2022 [ https://substack.com/redirect/5113fe4b-d765-41d5-b869-5170d896bdb4?r=o1saq ].

(1) NASA Sets Coverage for Artemis I Moon Mission Next Launch Attempt [ https://substack.com/redirect/77e9c0ff-4a01-4722-8701-49a96cedabd7?r=o1saq ]
 NASA is targeting 2:17 p.m. EDT on Saturday, Sept. 3, for the launch of Artemis I [ https://substack.com/redirect/51d2deed-92ab-48dd-a3e3-53107d1a2e4d?r=o1saq ], the first integrated test of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, Orion spacecraft, and the ground systems at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. There is a two-hour launch window for the next attempt.
 Let’s give this another go — after a false start on Monday, in which flight controllers called off the launch due to engine issues, Artemis I is again attempting to launch this Saturday afternoon. Artemis I is an uncrewed mission around the moon, but it is important as it will pave the way for future human-crewed lunar expeditions. The last time humans stepped on the moon was in 1972, over 50 years ago."

 Mark Andrews [ https://substack.com/redirect/d7f9489a-25cc-4342-96f3-448aa15186cf?r=o1saq ] for Wired
Auto companies are designing ways to build a car’s fuel cells into its frame, making electric rides cheaper, roomier, and able to hit ranges of 620 miles.
 A number of EV companies, including Tesla, are making key advancements on battery design. Specifically, the companies are coming up with innovative solutions to the “weight spiral” dilemma."
129_7,1662123511,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #10,"All EVs want longer range — but longer range traditionally requires larger battery packs which increase the weight of the car, which in turn requires larger brakes, which then, of course, means larger wheels and so on and so forth. But Tesla and a number of Chinese EV companies have a solution to this issue: integrating the battery into the structure of the car so that the battery cells power the vehicle and serve as its skeleton. Cars utilizing this approach aren’t widely commercially available today, but the tech should be incorporated in vehicles hitting the road starting in 2023.

Eric Lipton [ https://substack.com/redirect/567cfef6-b551-4836-a8ee-d3d9caa582c1?r=o1saq ] for The New York Times
The Metals Company, based in Vancouver, has secured exclusive access to tons of seabed rocks packed with cobalt, copper and nickel — enough, it says, to power 280 million electric vehicles [ https://substack.com/redirect/f62bf2aa-a07e-4122-abc6-f65fed5f48d7?r=o1saq ], equivalent to the entire fleet of cars in the United States.
 Whether batteries are packed in compact cells or distributed through the skeleton of the car, EVs will still be powered by batteries containing cobalt, copper, and nickel. One Canadian mining company, The Metals Company, was granted the rights to mine a seabed that contains enough of the valuable chemical elements to power the next wave of the EV revolution. Seabed mining has recently become an even more urgent topic; China has increasing control over cobalt markets, and Russia is a major nickel supplier. Seabed mining offers an alternative source to these highly sought after resources. However, as the article details, the rights to the seabeds (and the ways in which these rights were secured) are not without controversy.

Our friend Nathan Baschez argues that humans are pretty bad at forecasting use cases for nascent technologies, while also predicting how AI will be used in the future. His case is rather believable: instead of powering human-like systems, AI will be most useful in creating “tools endowed with intelligence, and capable of performing far more complex tasks than before.” AI, according to Nathan, isn’t one big thing that will roll out and change the world in one fell swoop, but rather, a modular set of much more powerful tools that will take on increasingly complex tasks.

For a primer on retention, make sure to read two of Lenny’s previous posts on the topic, How to increase your retention [ https://substack.com/redirect/0c83dc84-9504-433b-9a0f-96cef8b2fa8a?r=o1saq ] and What is good retention [ https://substack.com/redirect/99b863ee-274f-45f6-bf99-c7806303e4ec?r=o1saq ], to get an introduction and learn why it’s important to monitor and grow retention.
 To recap, retention measures the ability of your product to keep users active over time. Retention for consumer businesses would have a different meaning than for enterprise, B2B, or B2C companies:
Step 1. Define “active”
As you can see above, a fundamental variable in calculating retention for most products is “active users.” But it’s not obvious what “active” means.
"
132_15,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Below are the most common events used to define “active” across companies. Each of these events has its own downsides and limitations:
Visit: Too broad; you will overcount users, most likely having a challenge with unauthenticated and not registered users. Only relevant for the web.
"
132_16,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Session starts: You’ll possibly overcount users by pulling in unauthenticated IDs. You will also need to limit the session length to a specific time range that should be unique to your product usage. If you don’t do this, you are likely to count background app refreshes, notifications, and any other app activity that is not related to user activity (read more: This Is Why You Overcount Your Daily Active Users [ https://substack.com/redirect/3735121b-0fab-4684-b1c5-19c06765afd5?r=o1saq ]). 
 Login or app opens: Same as above, as you will need a way to exclude new users with their first app open event for cohorted retention and exclude unauthenticated users and duplicates.
 Web page views or screen views: Too broad; most likely will pull in all user types (dormant, lapsers, new users) into one bucket and over-report both DAU and retention. 
 Main user action (e.g. item view, search, log an exercise, transaction, etc.): Too narrow, and easy to miss active users who don’t do the main activity you expect but keep using the app (adjacent users [ https://substack.com/redirect/3947ecc5-e54b-4e0f-a5a5-5dc2eef53cfd?r=o1saq ] case), or they make a transaction from a different platform (app/web).
 At different companies, I had to report DAU and retention based on all these event variations, sometimes even mixing a few of them together (session start + app open + main transaction). 
 Most companies use logins or app opens as main events for the “active users” definition. But given that I always aim for the cleanest and most precise data reporting, I’d recommend using the main user action as the activity event, for example:
Pros to this approach: 
It ignores all the “noise” events, like visits, screen views, and logins, and tailors the activity event to only the main transaction or event that you expect a user most commonly does.
 It gives you the cleanest sample of truly active users, whose behavior you can monitor and validate.
 It is usually available across all platforms (unlike app open or visits) and data sources, making it easily accessible for reporting and monitoring.
 Regardless of your business type, my recommendation is to use the main user action to monitor not only retention but other user activity metrics like DAU, WAU, MAU, and DAU/MAU ratio.

132_18,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Differentiate users from customers
Once your team agrees on what “active” means for your product, the next step is to segment your active users into free vs. paid. Your retention will have a different logic for each of these groups.
 “A customer is defined as the person/group who is paying you. A user is a person using the product. In subscription products, oftentimes there are multiple users associated with a single customer. Or people are users before they are customers."

These metrics are your baseline for calculating retention."
132_21,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Now that you know who your active user or active customer is (e.g. a paid user who logged an exercise or a free user who read an article), you can start building retention to learn how often they come back. 
 Often a mistake I see SaaS companies make is reporting one “blended” retention, with a mix of free and paid users. This can be misleading, because users who pay for the product are likely to use it way more than free users. So the true activity of free users (and your “pool of opportunity” to convert) will be hidden.

132_22,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,Step 3.
132_23,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Pick your retention type
The next step in calculating retention is setting your timeline. As a team, you have to agree on what retention reporting type you should adopt:
X-day retention
Unbounded (rolling) retention 
The method you choose will significantly affect your results.
 1. X-day retention
X -day (also known as N-day or bounded) tells you the percentage of users who come back on a specific day. For example, for all users who join, what percentage return to your app on exactly day 14:
This is the most conservative retention approach and will return you a lower retention percentage.
 2. Unbounded retention
Unbounded retention tells you how many of your users got back on a specific day or later. For example, for all new users who joined on a specific day, what percentage of users are using the product after 14 days (and not necessarily on day 14).
 If your goal is to match retention with your user churn, this is the way to go. The unbounded retention value for month 6 gives you the percentage of users who returned after month 6.
"
132_24,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,So which approach should you use?
132_25,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Both are correct, yet both will return completely different retention data:
My general favorite method is unbounded retention because (1) I like my KPIs to be connected, proportional, and correlated to each other, and (2) unbounded retention is the inverse of churn, so it gives me another way to validate and test my data, increasing the confidence in my reporting (the higher the churn, the lower the retention, and vice versa).
 But you should pick the method that works best for your analytical objective and your users’ natural behavior: 
If your users use the product regularly (e.g. logging foods every morning, recording exercise, or listening to a podcast daily), use X-day retention.
 If your KPIs are coded to a specific time range (e.g. 30 days trial, 28 days active, 7 days resubscriber), then you probably want to also count only those users who return to your product within a set period of time and use the X-day method.
 If you don’t expect users to come back on an average daily/weekly/monthly basis, and the user engagement pattern is more chaotic, then use the unbounded method.    
 X-day retention is more appropriate for short-term analysis like measuring the onboarding funnel or marketing campaigns. 
 Unbounded retention is more useful for measuring long-term user behavior, especially if you want to segment your users into retention groups (6M, 9M, 1 year, 2 years).  
 Overall, a rule of thumb in analytics is that if your product is SaaS, you are likely to be tied to a specific time bound (paid subscription length, trial length, etc.). Because of that, it’s recommended to follow X-day retention. If you are not in SaaS but in a B2C or consumer transactional or social business, then you can be more flexible and adopt unbounded retention.

132_41,1661871639,lenny@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How to measure cohort retention,"Follow these steps to stay on track and get the correct retention logic:
Step 1: Get the users’ first (initial) action—this is usually sign-up or the first purchase
Step 2: Get the user activity after the sign-up or purchase—based on your activity definition
Step 3: Get the total time in between the initial and consecutive user action (“retained_time”)
Step 4: Convert the total time to days/weeks/months as needed
Step 5: Group users into buckets based on the total retained time from the previous step
Step 6: Map and order users’ buckets based on their initial action time—sign-up or the first purchase
 Depending on your underlying data and table structure, these steps can be done via a simple SELECT statement (like SELECT * FROM ready_to_use_retention_table) or another quick way, such as 
SELECT snapshot_date,
      start_date,
       n_period,
       COUNT(user_id) AS n_users
FROM subscriptions

These tools let you leverage their cohorted graphs, and each format can be grouped by (1) time period (e.g. daily, monthly, annually) and then by (2) user segments (e.g. trialers, resubscribers, power users) to make your analytics really powerful.

In the pivot table editor, you can drag the initial activity dates into rows and the retained period into columns. For cohorted charts, it’s recommended to apply a color scale (click on conditional formatting, choose a color scale, then pick a color option). Without color-coding, cohorts are difficult to read.

If you have new customers and their activity dates, you can plug them into his file and get retention calculations.
 Regarding retention visualization format, quite often I see a line chart or a stacked line chart.

It’s expected that retention for these cohorts will be significantly different. So you should always cohort your users into different behavioral segments if you can. Like I said, your ability to create multiple user cohorts is linearly correlated with how well your analytics is set up.
 In companies with more advanced data stacks, the product team has the ability to locate, test, iterate, and release new features to only specific user segments. Having these groups cleanly and precisely cohorted also speaks to the maturity of the analytical domain."

🤝 Retention measures the ability of your product to keep (1) users (2) active (3) over time.
 Depending on your business model and type, “users” can mean customers, free users, or free users with a purchase, so retention calculation and definition will be different.
 “Active” can be a range of activity events, and often you have to pick the event that is available, consistent across your platforms, and clean.
 “Over time” can be tricky to define—bound to a specific timeline or a rolling average? Pick your X-day or unbounded retention type based on your product usage.

 Other things to keep in mind
Given that retention includes so many elements of activity, it’s not the right metric to use for weekly reporting or as a baseline for an A/B test. Too often I have seen how product analytics teams evaluate experimentation against retention and wonder why the increase in user activity doesn’t lead to a change in retention. Because the activity is only one of the components of retention."

Therefore, product analytics should be flexible with the dashboards and data sources to adopt whatever new retention meaning is requested (for example, changing app_open event to login, or 30-day retention calculation to rolling 28 days).  
 I’ll stop here, but there is much more to retention to cover—the specifics of revenue retention reporting, retention differences between SaaS and B2C or B2B, handling user outliers, working with retention curve patterns, retention growth-rate benchmarks, and more.

 The person responsible for ‘marketing’ at a seed stage company

 It is a THANKLESS job.

 And maybe, a fool’s errand.

3 reasons for this…

really doing marketing. They’re fumbling around in the dark
trying to find the magical intersection of:* right features
* right customers
* right price point
* right business model

* Because of those 2 things, there aren’t many examples of what
“good” pre Product-Market Fit marketing looks like. So you’re
automatically behind the 8 Ball as a marketer stepping into a
role at one of these companies.

 The result is that you see a lot of sub 1 year stints in
marketing at seed stage B2B companies.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

brauchen wir in Europa wirklich einen weiteren Fast-Fashion-Marktplatz,
der mit Millioneninvestitionen und ""Haul Videos"", in denen Massenkonsum
propagiert wird, in den Markt dringt? Als ich mich für meinen neuesten
Artikel mit Trendyol befasst habe, musste ich immer wieder an diese
Dokumentation

der katastrophalen Folgen des Fast-Fashion-Booms in Ghana denken. Und
doch wächst Trendyol offenbar so schnell, dass der Marktplatz laut
Google Trends schon mehr ""Brand Searches"" verzeichnet als About You.
 Bildet Euch selbst eine Meinung...

Start somewhere. Roland

Der türkischstämmige Online-Marktplatz Trendyol war bislang in
Deutschland nur wenig bekannt; nun expandiert das Unternehmen mit Macht
in den hiesigen Markt. Bis zum Jahr 2025 soll das Handelsvolumen des
deutschen Marktplatzes auf drei Milliarden Euro steigen. Dafür baut das
Unternehmen nicht nur ein Team in Berlin auf, sondern investiert hohe
Summen ins Influencer Marketing. OMR erklärt die Hintergründe,
analysiert die Marketingstrategie und prüft, wie erfolgreich sie
bislang ist. 

DAS WILL ICH LESEN  

♪☑️ Tiktok will kein Targeting-Opt-in einholen - nun warnen
Datenschützer

Vor einem knappen Monat hat Tiktok gegenüber den Nutzer:innen aus dem
europäischen Wirtschaftsraum, Großbritannien und der Schweiz
angekündigt
,
die Rechtsgrundlage für personalisierte Werbung auf der eigenen
Plattform umstellen zu wollen. Bislang hatte Tiktok die Einwilligung der
Nutzenden für diese Art von Werbung eingeholt - vom 13. Juli an will
das Unternehmen das nicht mehr tun, sondern sich auf ""berechtigte
Interessen"" berufen. Doch nun versucht die italienische
Datenschutzbehörde die Pläne zu stoppen. 

Was passiert da genau? Mehrere

Datenschutzaktivisten
hatten bereits
bei Tiktoks Bekanntgabe der Pläne Bedenken angemeldet, ob diese
rechtmäßig sind. Nun hat die italienische Datenschutzbehörde SA
Tiktok ein ""formale Warnung"" ausgesprochen (hier die englischsprachige
Pressemitteilung dazu
).
 Die Verarbeitung von persönlichen Daten (insbesondere von Kindern) auf
Basis ""berechtigter Interessen"" stünde nicht im Einklang mit den
aktuellen rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Die Behörde behalte sich
zusätzliche Schritte vor, wenn Tiktok keinen Rückzieher mache. Einen
ausführlichen Bericht über die Vorgänge findet ihr bei Techcrunch
.

 The bigger picture: Mit weiterhin zunehmenden Nutzer:innenzahlen steigen
auch Tiktoks Werbeumsätze: Nach Schätzungen von Marktforscher
Emarketer

werden diese im laufenden Jahr um 200 Prozent auf 11,6 Milliarden
US-Dollar wachsen. Tiktok buhlt mit Nachdruck darum, dass noch mehr
Unternehmen und Werbetreibende auf der Plattform aktiv werden ; gerade
hat die Plattform einen sechswöchigen Kurs für KMUs gelauncht
.
 Die aktuellen Vorgänge rund um personalisierte Werbung sind ein Beleg
dafür, wie wenig reguliert das Marketing auf Tiktok aktuell noch ist.
 Laut einer Untersuchung des US-Blog Vox
wird
auch Influencer Marketing auf Tiktok aktuell noch sehr selten als
Werbung gekennzeichnet.

  Newsbites: Klarna, Instagram, Wefox & Ebay
Kleinanzeigen

Fast 40 Milliarden verpufft: Der ""Buy Now, Pay Later""-Dienst Klarna, der
sich auch als Werbe-

und Marketingplattform
etablieren
will, hat in einer neuen Funding-Runde 800 Millionen US-Dollar von neuen
und bestehenden Investoren eingesammelt
.
"
137_3,1657625490,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?Q?Hat_Trendyol_About_You_=C3=BCberholt=3F?=,"Die Firmenbewertung sank dabei von 45,6 Milliarden US-Dollar auf 6,7
Milliarden US-Dollar. Gründer und CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski machte in
einem trotzigen Twitter-Thread
vor allem das
Marktumfeld für die Downround verantwortlich.

 Vom Desktop aus streamen: Instagram testet laut Techcrunch

gerade ein ""Live Producer""-Tool, mit dem Nutzende auf Desktop-Geräten
mit externer Software Livestreams auf der Plattform durchführen
können. Der Schritt könnte es Unternehmen und Marken leichter machen,
auf Instagram live zu streamen.

400-Millionen-Regen: Das deutsche Insurtech-Startup Wefox sammelt ein
weiteres Investment von 400 Millionen US-Dollar ein und ist damit nun
4,5 Milliarden US-Dollar wert, wie die Kollegen von Finance Forward
berichten .

 Ende einer Ära: ""Ebay Kleinanzeigen"" wird sich in ""Kleinanzeigen""
umbenennen

und hat sich dafür auch die Domain Kleinanzeigen.de gesichert. Ebay
hatte das Kleinanzeigengeschäft 2021 an das norwegische Unternehmen
Adevinta verkauft.

 Investing Lessons of the “Crypto Corporate Raiders” 

“And another one gone. Another one bites the dust…” so goes the Queen classic, and pretty much every crypto related headline nowadays.   This latest “winter” is more like an Ice Age. So far it's claimed $2.05 trillion in market value, more than 2130 jobs, and at least 4 major firms. Ah, music to the ears… well, at least to some. 

"
140_2,1657709624,news@execsum.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Twitter vs. Musk =?UTF-8?B?8J+lig==?=,"Like “crypto white knight” Sam Bankman-Fried, whose FTX stands to acquire BlockFi at a 95% discount. Or Goldman Sachs, who is reportedly putting together an investment group to acquire $2 billion of distressed assets from crypto-lender Celsius.

Eat your heart out, Carl Icahn. 

 Here’s the takeaway:

· Be ready to respond to changing market conditions

· Don't put all your eggs in one basket


That's why I’ve been diversifying my portfolio with real assets like fine art. It's been a great hedge – appreciating over 33% annually the last time inflation was this high – outpacing gold and stocks. And as the S&P crumbled 21% in 1H 2022, the art market was up 25%.

One of the things that makes the future so hard to predict is that new technologies don’t operate in silos; they’re intertwining threads that weave together in unpredictable ways. 
 Uber is a canonical weave: for anyone to be able to dial up a ride from their pocket, GPS, smartphones, payments, and online ratings systems needed to combine in ways that their respective inventors couldn’t have predicted. This conversation between Patrick O’Shaughnessy and Kenneth Stanley [https://substack.com/redirect/477be772-2ce5-4d03-998d-fddb03fe4389?u@394114] is rich with examples of discrete innovations combining in ways that couldn’t be planned, like the invention of the vacuum tube unintentionally leading to the computer.
 As the individual technological threads each get wilder and more powerful than they were in previous generations – replace “vacuum tubes” with “AI” as an input, for example – I suspect that the remixed outputs will be even harder to predict.
 Even in sci-fi, where the job is to imagine fictional futures by extrapolating technological progress, most of the technology is fairly linear extrapolation: fusion-powered spaceships, AI robots, terraforming."
143_22,1658148826,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Intertwining Threads,"I think we’ll have all of that at some point, but I also think we’ll have all sorts of crazy combinations that are harder to predict, and then we’ll have crazier combinations of those crazy combinations. 
 To show you what I mean, we’ll walk through some simple examples (with the caveat that these are just some of the ones I can dream up; the crowd will create things that make these look quaint).
 Over the weekend, I came across this thread: 
When I first saw OpenAI [https://substack.com/redirect/bd520c05-abcc-4059-93d3-32190a20b35e?u@394114]’s DALL•E 2 in the wild [https://substack.com/redirect/0f8d5498-cf34-4f4f-b51d-0ee93c3fcf4c?u@394114] a few months ago, the first thing I thought was, “Woah.”"
143_23,1658148826,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Intertwining Threads,"The second thing I thought was, “It’s going to be really wild when this gets combined with other technology.”"
143_24,1658148826,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Intertwining Threads,"I started jotting down notes for an essay on combining technologies, then I abandoned it for a couple months until I saw Nicholas Ptacek’s tweet.

 Hi friends 👋, 
Happy Monday! Big week here at Not Boring HQ: Friday was Puja and my 5th anniversary (Happy Anniversary Puj!), tomorrow is Dev’s 2nd birthday, and Thursday is Maya’s 2-month birthday. 
 Last year, when Dev turned 1, I wrote Dad Life [ https://substack.com/redirect/f472625b-1103-4c0b-b318-442a63ac4fc1?r=o1saq ], a piece about working and raising a kid at the same time. I wasn’t planning on writing a similar piece for his birthday this year, but I’ve been thinking a lot about a related question and the timing worked perfectly. 
 The question is: how the hell are you supposed to educate a kid today? 
 Dev and Maya get a blank educational slate to start with. Puja and I are responsible for figuring out how to give them the best education possible, one that helps them love learning, have fun, and get prepared for life beyond school. I don’t think the answer is as simple as “Get them into the best schools possible.” I think it’s a lot more complicated than that, and will only get more complicated as things move faster.

148_13,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"There are a million little trade-offs like that, though rarely quite so on the nose. Historically, the way to deal with a big lump of those trade-offs is, eventually, to try to put your kids in the best schools possible and make sure that they’re doing their homework and getting good grades and doing all of the extracurriculars, which serve double duty as resume fillers and extra childcare. 
 But thanks to the pandemic and our jobs, Puja and I have been lucky enough to be home most of the time, getting to spend time with Dev and Maya, getting to watch them get smarter every day, like little human large language models with big emotions. At the same time, the real large language models have been getting stronger by the day, surprisingly upending creative work first, which has made me reflect on what the world will look like when they’re older, and how to prepare them for that world. What will people need to know in a world in which the Enchanted Notebook [ https://substack.com/redirect/2cee0fbb-b004-4b22-90e1-9960416bbc3e?r=o1saq ] exists?
While we’ll still put them in school – Dev started a couple weeks ago, for a few hours three days a week – it’s become clear that if we want them to grow up to be uniquely them to the fullest of their potential, and stay ahead of seemingly daily advances, we need to do a lot more than that.

"
148_16,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"There are these charts that pop up every once in a while that show how much graduates of certain majors make or which majors are becoming more popular. 
 One that has recently caught peoples’ attention is this chart that shows that computer science degrees are on the rise, and humanities degrees are on an equal and opposite decline."
148_17,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"This chart has caused either celebration (“Good! People are studying things that will help them get jobs.”) or anguish (“Oh no! The death of humanities will lead to a duller, less ethical and moral society.”). 
"
148_18,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"I don’t have a strong view. What struck me when I looked at the chart, and the related hot takes on Twitter, was just how hard it must be for educational institutions at all levels to keep up with the increasing rate of change in the world. 
 It’s an oft-cited fact that the modern education system was created during the Industrial Revolution to prepare children to grow up to work in factories. “Factory schools,” as they were called, sprang up in Prussia in the 19th Century and quickly spread throughout the industrialized world, to teach kids to be “punctual, docile, and sober [ https://substack.com/redirect/aef0cc00-ae0f-4e4a-bd5e-23fcba4385ba?r=o1saq ].” Moving from the family farm to the corporate factory required a different set of skills and behaviors, and schools stepped in to teach them. 
 That model worked well, and persisted for two centuries, in part, I would guess, because the types of jobs that people were going to get after school, and the skills they would need for those jobs, stayed relatively static. And a literate, numerate population trained to follow orders generalized well. The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit [ https://substack.com/redirect/fdf3b1f3-4141-4059-8ffb-6d8ce875205e?r=o1saq ] worked in an office instead of a factory, and wore nicer clothes, but was still expected to be punctual, docile, and sober. 
 While some of the details have changed, the system works largely the same way today, even among the top students at the best schools. 
"
148_19,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"When I asked people for their favorite essays [ https://substack.com/redirect/1f76ab8e-ffe5-432d-a08d-c9c3f82a027b?r=o1saq ], William Deresiewicz’s Solitude and Leadership [ https://substack.com/redirect/b81e9f98-ccb7-48b7-8f45-7f685fab657d?r=o1saq ] was one of the most frequently-recommended (I marked it up with notes in Readwise Reader here [ https://substack.com/redirect/2f59b15c-2732-42d6-b810-8dc135be3545?r=o1saq ]). The essay is the transcript of a talk Deresiewicz, a former Yale English professor and author, gave to the incoming plebe class at West Point in 2009. 
 While at Yale, Deresiewicz spent some time on the admissions committee, where he experienced this: 
 Well, it turned out that a student who had six or seven extracurriculars was already in trouble. Because the students who got in—in addition to perfect grades and top scores—usually had 10 or 12.

"
148_23,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"While I don’t have answers to the very difficult question of how to educate millions of kids, kids of all backgrounds and levels of income and aptitude and parental support, and I don’t envy those who have to come up with those answers, it’s become pretty clear to me that optimizing just for my own kids, the factory school model, or the more modern excellent sheep model, won’t work. 
 I say that as an excellent sheep myself."
148_24,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"I was lucky enough to go to great private schools and to Duke. I was a good student. I did a lot of extracurriculars. I remember one weekend in high school when I had a debate tournament one night, ran in Pennsylvania Cross Country State Championship (and finished All-State) the next morning, and drove back to my high school to perform in the school play that same night. In college, I studied econ, because I wanted to go into finance, and then spent four years in a finance job I didn’t love doing work I didn’t really care about and that I realized I was worse at than a lot of people who were plain smarter and actually loved the work. 
 It took me a decade post-college, and unemployment at the start of a global pandemic, to find the thing that I was uniquely good at: writing a newsletter, of all things.
 I think that a lot of the things I did, in a roundabout way, contributed to what Not Boring has become. Debate helped me frame an argument, finance helped me use a spreadsheet, running helped me put in countless hours of hard work with almost no benefit to show for it for over a year. In retrospect, I wouldn’t change a thing about my education because I’m really happy with where it’s all led. Serendipity is part of the process, and my parents raised us to be able to follow it. They led by example – both leaving good, stable jobs to start their own things – and as a result, my sister, brother, and I all started our own things. 
 But I also want our kids to be better off than us, something that only a depressing 32% of Americans expect to be true for their children:
 Finances aside, Dev and Maya will set their own definitions of “better off” and their own goals in life, but when I think about how I want to guide them, the words “Philosopher King and Queen” come to mind. 
 The idea, put forth by Plato in The Republic, is that the ideal polis, the kallipolis, or beautiful city, should be ruled by philosophers who love knowledge, who seek truth and ideals instead of power."
148_25,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"It’s an idea as beautiful as it is impractical. Plato is essentially calling for benevolent dictatorship and assuming that there exist people who absolute power wouldn’t corrupt absolutely. If some people throughout history may have fit the bill, they’re too few and far between for benevolent dictatorship to be a realistic form of governance, so we’re left with democracy, “the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.” 
 I still think it’s a good north star for raising a kid, particularly when those kids are going to grow up into a world in which they’ll have more power at their fingertips than our generation can even imagine."
148_26,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"Dev and Maya won’t be Philosopher King and Queen of the United States, but they’ll be Philosopher King and Queen of their own little worlds. 
 They and their fellow Gen Alphas will command personalized AI and govern decentralized organizations and access overwhelming amounts of information and bring ideas to life with Enchanted Notebooks [ https://substack.com/redirect/2cee0fbb-b004-4b22-90e1-9960416bbc3e?r=o1saq ] and shape biology itself, and I think that it’s going to be important for them to grow up with a philosopher’s love of truth and wisdom and a benevolent monarch’s sense of fairness and goodness. And above all else, I want them to have a critical curiosity and pragmatic optimism, a willingness to explore new things openly and excitedly but with a more incisive and critical eye than I have. 
 And I think that the Factory School / Excellent Sheep model is increasingly incapable of making that happen. 
"
148_27,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"For one thing, I have no idea what skills are going to be in-demand in twenty years, when Dev would graduate college, or twenty-two, when Maya would. There’s no factory job waiting on the other side, the corporate ladder gets more slippery every year, and the well-worn banking/consulting/law/medicine path seems less certain. 
 Ok, well duh consulting and banking aren’t the sure-things they once were."
148_28,1664801529,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How Do I Teach These Kids?!,"Everyone who makes real money today knows how to code. That’s why college students are abandoning the humanities in favor of computer science. Teach a kid to code, feed her for a lifetime. We sent Dev to a school that will start to teach him the very basics of coding next year, when he’s three."

An enterprising young student figured out that she could use GPT-3 to help write her essays (she used it as a starting point, and then made the essays her own). Writing good essays became so easy, in fact, that she was able to write her classmates’ essays, too, for a $100 profit.

While I sympathize with the teacher – spending your life grading papers written by AI does seem incredibly depressing – I want to teach my kids to be more like Urdagirl69. By that, I don’t specifically mean that I want to teach them how to use GPT-3 to write essays and build a modern paper-farm lemonade stand, but that I want to teach them to have the curiosity, agency, and initiative to use whatever tools they have at their disposal to do the best work possible.

 That doesn’t mean that there shouldn’t be rules, or that we should teach them to break the rules for rule-breaking’s sake. Setting boundaries seems important, if only so they can find creative ways around them. 
 On a recent Lunar Society podcast episode [ https://substack.com/redirect/2f02832a-8125-44d1-baf0-7af1dafb3328?r=o1saq ], Dwarkesh Patel asked Tyler Cowen if we should just let high schoolers go wild and educate themselves without structure, and Cowen’s response seems instructive for designing educational systems in a world in which kids can write essays with AI:

157_1,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"There’s been a ton of talk – in ecommerce, media, SaaS, and web3 – about the importance of community. There are far fewer actual examples of building community-first in a way that translates into real metrics. Glossier comes to mind as a good example of a similar idea, content-to-commerce, and many companies build strong communities within their customer bases, but starting with the community is rare. 
 The idea of starting with a community and then building products and services specifically for them is one I’ve been obsessed with for a while. When I was thinking about launching Not Boring Club pre-COVID, I wrote a memo-to-self in Notion on just this topic: 
If I’m being honest, the target customer I was thinking of for Not Boring Club would have been too diffuse to pull off a community-first business really well."

ABC. Always Be Closing. 
 Partially thanks to Glenngary, Glen Ross, partially thanks to those calls and emails you get, and partially thanks to cringe posts on LinkedIn, sales has developed a cartoonish reputation. 
 While sales is a great way to make a lot of money, and the best path for non-technical people to get into tech, it’s not a career that most people dream of, the way they dream of becoming engineers or product managers or designers or founders.

“Sales is the best job in the world.” 
 Sahil’s enthusiasm for sales is infectious, and his pitch worked. Not Boring Capital invested in Bravado’s Series B, a $26 million round led by Tiger with participation from Redpoint, Freestyle Capital, Flow Ventures, Precursor Ventures, Mark Pincus, and my friends Lenny Rachitsky [ https://substack.com/redirect/017528e2-9a9d-4cd8-a884-c9f409bc6510?r=o1saq ] and Sahil Bloom [ https://substack.com/redirect/02a8ef46-4e1d-4ba8-90c2-237b73aa237b?r=o1saq ].

157_12,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,I wasn’t sure it answered
157_13,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"the “So what?” question I ask when I’m considering an investment, or that sales software counted as a hard startup [ https://substack.com/redirect/13f73e79-beb3-4d34-bd0d-694ea0f36adc?r=o1saq ]. But I trust JAE and there were a bunch of things to love about the company and the industry it’s tackling: 
Industry: Sales is the #1 most popular role in the country, and B2B Sales is the 3rd fastest-growing
Grit: Sahil started Bravado five years ago, and they’ve had a product in-market for 3.5 years, but they didn’t start monetizing until last year. 
 Growth: Bravado scaled from $0 to $4 million in ARR in 9 months when it launched its Jobs product with Sahil as, ironically, the company’s only salesperson
It all clicked, though, when Sahil laid out the approach Bravado’s taken to get to where it is, and the optionality that gives the company in the future."
157_14,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"It’s that approach that we’re going to dive into today: community-first distribution. 
 In The Good Thing About Hard Things, I wrote that “Hard startups on the bits side are solving difficult technical challenges, creating new business models, or touching industries that previously didn’t make sense to touch.”
 While community-first isn’t a brand new business model – every company and DAO talks about building community-first – Bravado has executed on that playbook brilliantly, building a community for years before monetizing it effectively, in a way that I haven’t seen before. 
 Sahil calls it “reverse engineering a SaaS company.” Instead of building software for salespeople and then bolting on a community of customers, a brand, conferences, and the like, Sahil started by building a free professional network for salespeople, like “StackOverflow for Sales”: one place where salespeople can go to get better at their jobs.
 It was a slog, and after three years in the trenches, the community didn’t really take off until last year, when the company decided to make its message boards pseudonymous so that, unlike LinkedIn, “people can ask for real advice without bloviating.” With that one shift, Bravado’s free product, the War Room, took off. Today, Bravado has over 250,000 salespeople in its network, representing 50,000 companies. And those 250k people had to go through some friction to get there; I went through the signup process, and it’s a meaty eleven steps, including connecting LinkedIn to verify your responses. 
 That traction is a clear sign that Bravado fills a hole in the market for salespeople who want to get better at their jobs by learning from a community of top sellers. . Out of over 4,000 accredited universities in the US, only 50 have a major or minor in sales. There’s no Dribbble or Figma for salespeople, like there is for designers. Salespeople have made do on LinkedIn, but there’s gotta be a better way to get tips and advice, and to just celebrate a win, than doing it in view of your whole professional network. 
 That’s the hole War Room fills, but War Room is just the first step in a brilliant strategy to build products for the community that Bravado has so patiently built. The reason Sahil built Bravado in the first place was to build better products for salespeople after realizing that all of the existing ones “are awful.” But in a market dominated by a giant like Salesforce, he knew he couldn’t just build a product and try to sell it the same way all of the would-be Salesforce-killers have tried.  
 The community-first strategy has paid off handsomely for Bravado. Thanks to War Room, when Bravado turned on its first paid product, Jobs, it grew to $4 million in revenue in 9 months at a $4 blended Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) with 95% organic growth. When the hiring market recently turned sour, it listened to its members in the War Room, built off of the Jobs product foundation, and quickly launched Flex. Flex, which lets sales professionals work as Freelancers, opens up new options for the future of Bravado, for who gets hired, and how salespeople leverage themselves. 
 That’s what building community-first enables: optionality."
157_15,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"With the War Room humming, Bravado’s just getting started on its quest to build better products for salespeople. In the process, it’s rewriting the playbook for bottoms-up, community-first go to market. I think that integrating this deeply with the community will become table stakes for new SaaS startups that want to build deep moats going forward.

When kids are growing up, someone wants to be an astronaut. Someone wants to be a firefighter. These days, I think a lot of people want to be a tech founder or an engineer.

But while he was in college in Washington, DC, he did what people in DC do: got involved in politics. Specifically, he joined the Obama Campaign in Field Operations. 
 Field Operations is essentially sales."
157_20,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"Going door-to-door explaining your candidate’s position, hosting events to get people excited, and lots and lots of cold calling."
157_21,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"And Sahil loved it. He had found his calling. 
"
157_22,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"After school, Sahil joined Meltwater, a 600 person sales organization, as a Sales Manager, and quickly became the #1 sales representative in the company’s 10-year history. Within two years, he was promoted to Managing Director and sold to companies like Exxon, Prudential, Pernod Ricard, AIG, Panera Bread, and the Air Force. 
 He left Meltwater in 2011 to become the 23rd employee at a little startup called Glassdoor [ https://substack.com/redirect/3b41ab4b-2d61-46d9-9f71-1577e4b7b6c5?r=o1saq ] as an Enterprise Sales Manager. Selling to companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, he was the #1 rep out of 50 in his first year with the company. 
 Moving on up, Sahil got hired as the VP of Sales at a smaller startup called Virool, and there, he became the largest customer of a tiny Israeli company, SalesPredict, building a predictive AI lead scoring tool. The product wasn’t intuitive for the user, and when Sahil gave feedback to the SalesPredict team, they asked him to join them and fix it himself.
 In his time in sales, Sahil had realized two things about sales software:
All sales tools are awful. 
 There’s no bottoms-up sales tooling.
"
157_23,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"He wanted to understand why that was, so he took the job and joined SalesPredict to help build its product. Working with designers, engineers, and data scientists, he needed to brush up on his technical skills, so he started learning R. When he got stuck on an issue, he turned to his now co-founder Yoni Acriche to ask for help, and Yoni replied, “Oh, just Google it.”
 So he copy-pasted the code he was having trouble with into Google, and voila… 
 The exact issue popped up in Stack Overflow [ https://substack.com/redirect/db0551d7-776d-49cc-ab11-b25056a019d4?r=o1saq ], the “public platform building the definitive collection of coding questions & answers,” with dozens of helpful answers. 
"
157_24,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"“Why doesn’t something like this exist in sales?” he wondered. 
 Then, when he was interviewing a designer, she sent him a link to her portfolio in Dribbble [ https://substack.com/redirect/7643493c-b49a-4e3d-ad5e-881b0e01da16?r=o1saq ], the community where creatives share their work. 
 Once again, he wondered, “Why doesn’t something like this exist for sales?” 
 The question kept coming back up as he played with the delightful software that non-salespeople got to use, right when the “consumerization of enterprise software [ https://substack.com/redirect/2ea44a6f-0eb3-4847-b235-52ac3f5ae48e?r=o1saq ]” was in full swing, and became increasingly intent on bringing the same level of software to sales."
157_25,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"Finally, in the summer of 2016, eBay acquired SalesPredict for $40 million [ https://substack.com/redirect/7af4f244-1ac1-44b5-b8b3-81c6226748ab?r=o1saq ], and Sahil decided it was time to scratch the itch.  
"
157_26,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"But having spent so much time in sales at early-stage startups, Sahil knew what a grind it was getting even really good software in customers’ hands via the traditional enterprise sales model, so he set out to flip the script.
 Meet Bravado: The Anti-SaaS SaaS Company
Product-led, or bottoms-up, growth has become a popular approach to customer acquisition for consumerized software startups. Give away a free version of software that a handful of employees love to use, make it really easy for them to sign up for pro features with a credit card, and then layer on sales using those early adopters as a beachhead for the company-wide deal."

While “No one ever got fired for buying Salesforce” certainly isn’t true in the long-run, it sounds right in the short-term. 
 Given his decade-plus in sales, Sahil knew that he wasn’t going to win the sales tools category with a traditional enterprise sales approach, or even with a bottoms-up approach. “The push to the first few million in ARR is really hard and expensive,” he explained, “until you build a brand, get reviews, write case studies, earn trust, host conferences, and build momentum.” 
 Instead, Sahil decided to take a different tact."

 By building community-first, Bravado was building a brand, getting access to a pool of customer insights, and actually developing its own distributed sales team for its eventual products. 
"
157_44,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,Think of it this way.
157_45,1659617594,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,The ABCs of Bravado,"Software companies typically generate high margins by building products with high fixed costs (typically R&D) and low marginal costs (it costs practically nothing to make copies of the software). Build once, sell millions of times, profit. Of course, there are still marginal customer acquisition costs – it takes some amount of money to convince each customer to use or buy the product. What Bravado is doing has a similar logic. It spent high upfront costs building a community of its target customers, and now, it should be able to distribute new products to them and through them at low marginal customer acquisition costs.
 So Bravado started simple, with a community for salespeople. 
 People joined, but growth was slow. Bravado experimented with new formats."

 To learn how Bravado caught lightning in a bottle, and how it turned community-first into real revenue in 7 months…

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

rund 130 Milliarden US-Dollar sind die 22, in der aktuellen
Podcast-Folge besprochenen, Firmen derzeit wert. Im internationalen
Vergleich ist das nicht gerade viel, aber nur um den Wert geht es im
Ranking der ""besten"" 22 Unternehmen, die in diesem Jahrtausend bislang
in Deutschland gegrÃ¼ndet wurden, auch nicht."
162_1,1662038588,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Die 22 besten Firmen des Jahrtausends,"Zwei Stunden hat Philipp Westermeyer mit Philipp KlÃ¶ckner und Florian
Adomeit darÃ¼ber diskutiert, worauf es neben dem harten Faktor Market
Cap noch ankommt - und weshalb so auch weniger wertvolle Firmen sehr
weit oben gelandet sind. Nehmt Euch die Zeit fÃ¼r die etwas andere, aber
absolut hÃ¶renswerte Analyse.

auf harten Faktoren wie zum Beispiel Jahresumsatz oder Bewertung. Und

 âœ… GrÃ¶ÃŸter Verifizierungs-Betrug auf Instagram aller Zeiten?

 Der meist blaue Haken im Profil hat auf nahezu allen
Social-Media-Plattformen einen echten Wert. FÃ¼r User und Fans ist es
das Zeichen, dass es sich bei einem Account um ihren echten
Lieblingsstar handelt. Und fÃ¼r Marken kann es die BestÃ¤tigung sein,
Kooperationen und Werbedeals anzubieten, selbst wenn man noch nie vom
Account gehÃ¶rt hat, er ist ja schlieÃŸlich verifiziert. Kurz: Der blaue
Haken ist bares Geld wert. Genau diese Logik hat sich offenbar eine
Gruppe zunutze gemacht - und mit dem Handel von Verifizierungen
Millionen kassiert.

 Die Details: Die Investigativ-Plattform propublica.org hat ein
Verifizierungs-System aufgedeckt, das mittels Profilen auf
Musikplattformen wie Spotify und Apple Music, SEO-Texten und gekauften
Klicks sowie Plays dafÃ¼r gesorgt hat, dass Profile auf Instagram
verifiziert wurden
.
 Der Strippenzieher soll demnach ein aufstrebender DJ und Krypto-Bro aus
Miami sein: Dillon Shamoun. Propublica schÃ¤tzt den so generierten
Umsatz auf mehrere Millionen. 25.000 bis 100.000 US-Dollar wÃ¤ren pro
blauem Haken gezahlt worden.

162_4,1662038588,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Die 22 besten Firmen des Jahrtausends,"Spotify habe bereits Ã¼ber 100 der zum Scam gehÃ¶renden
Profile gelÃ¶scht, Apple Music ebenfalls einige. Die Meta-Profile von
Shamoun wurden ebenfalls gelÃ¶scht. Er selber gibt das
Verification-Scam-Business Ã¼brigens nicht zu. Adam Quinn, ein Creator,
dessen Instagram-Account mit Ã¼ber zwei Millionen Followern bereits im
Juni gesperrt wurde, solle hinter dem GeschÃ¤ft stecken. Quinn hatte in
der Vergangenheit eng mit Influencer und Boxer Jake Paul
zusammengearbeitet. 

   Newsbites: Metas Paid-PlÃ¤ne, virtuelle Influencerin, Flinks
SparplÃ¤ne

 Facebook kostenpflichtig? Meta arbeitet mit einer neuen Einheit an
kostenpflichtigen Features fÃ¼r Facebook, Instagram und Whatsapp. Um
werbefreie Accounts soll es dabei nicht gehen
.
 In welche Richtung genau die Features gehen kÃ¶nnten, verrÃ¤t der
Konzern nicht. 

Sie heiÃŸt Yuna: Seit einigen Jahren erhalten virtuelle Influencer:innen
immer grÃ¶ÃŸere Reichweiten und teilweise sogar groÃŸe Deals mit Marken.
 Jetzt steigt auch ProSiebenSat.1 Ã¼ber Studio71 in das GeschÃ¤ft ein
.Â  Â 

Flinker RÃ¼ckzug: Nach einem riesigen Hype und starkem Wachstum steht
die Quick-Commerce-Branche vor groÃŸen Herausforderungen. Auch Flink
bekommt das zu spÃ¼ren - und will sich jetzt von 40 LagerflÃ¤chen in
Deutschland trennen
.

Hi Lisa,

Glückwunsch zu der wirklich starken YuLife Runde, ich liebe das “Win-Win”
Mindset von Ihnen!

 Der START Summit 2022 war ein ganzer Erfolg, mit über *3,7 Tsd. Startup
begeisterten Teilnehmern* aus dem Europäischen Ökosystem, und Größen wie *Neil
Rimer* (Co-Founder Index Ventures), * Luciana Lixandru* (Partner Sequoia)
und *Julian Teicke* (Founder wefox).

 Ich werde vom *18-20.07 in Berlin* sein, und wollte die Zeit nutzen, um
Simon zu treffen und

   1. den Summit 2022 kurz zusammenzufassen
   2. zu fragen, was euch gut gefallen hat und wo Verbesserungspotenzial in
   der Kooperation besteht
   3. zu zeigen, wie *Creandum Value vom Summit generiert*

Ich werde *nicht länger als 30min* brauchen. Ich freue mich schon!

Beste Grüße,

Ruben"

Sorry für die verspätete Antwort, ich war leider im Prüfungsstress.

Schade, dass Simon nächstes Jahr keine Zeit. Nichtsdestotrotz würde ich
gerne die Einladung offen halten sollte sich etwas ändern.

 Zudem veranstalten wir am 24. März ein exklusives Side Event mit 300
ausgewählten führenden Persönlichkeiten aus Wirtschaft und Politik, jungen
UnternehmerInnen und herausragenden Studierenden im neuen Learning Center
der Universität. Ziel dieses Events ist es, den generationenübergreifenden
Dialog sowie Perspektivenwechsel zu fördern, wozu wir Euch natürlich
ebenfalls herzlich einladen würden. Andere Teilnehmer werden unter anderem
Luciana Lixandru, Christian Angermayer oder Judith Dada sein.

 Beste Grüsse,
Tim

Ryan J. Salva is the VP of Product at GitHub, where he led the incubation and launch of Copilot [ https://substack.com/redirect/c80bd291-b94d-4dfa-8de9-3fd885574e77?r=o1saq ]. Copilot uses OpenAI’s ML engine to suggest code and entire functions in real time, right from your editor, and is changing the way we build software. Ryan is an experienced developer and product manager, with over a decade of experience working for Microsoft before moving to lead the GitHub product team. In today’s episode, he shares how Copilot got its start, how it moved from prototype to live product, and how he structures R&D teams within larger companies. He also discusses the ethical questions surrounding AI use and how to build a successful product team, and shares the inside story of the development of Copilot.

kein Problem und danke der Nachfrage: Georg reist selbst an, er lebt in
Zürich und er braucht keinen Transfer.
 Julian landet um 10:40 am Flughafen ZRH und es wäre super wenn er abgeholt
wird. Seine Flugnummer lautet  LH 1186 falls ihr diese braucht.
 Uns ist bewusst, dass die Zeit knapp bemessen ist, aber aufgrund von
Terminen in Berlin war nur diese Verbindung möglich.

 Julian wird im Anschluss an den Fireside Chat um 14:30 wieder abgeholt.
 Hier braucht er keine weiter Unterstützung.

 Vielen lieben Dank und viel Erfolg für den Endspurt :)

Das Panel findet am Freitag um 12:20 statt, der Fireside Chat dann um
13:55.

 Wird Julian am 25. anreisen oder bereits am 24.? Am Abend des 24. werden
wir abends noch ein exklusives Networking Dinner mit allen Speakern,
Investoren und Gründern haben. Wir würden uns freuen, wenn Julian daran
teilnehmen kann. Wir würden natürlich ein Hotel für die Übernachtung
organisieren.

 Zusätzlich wollen wir dort auch eine kleine Panel Diskussion zwischen
erfahrenen und jungen GründerInnen. Falls Julian am Forum teilnehmen kann,
wäre er potentiell bereit hieran teilzunehmen

Bei uns hat sich mittlerweile einiges getan, daher kurz die wichtigsten
Updates:


   - Das Europa Panel findet am Freitag Mittag statt, und die dritte Panel
   Teilnehmerin wird Luciana Lixandru von Sequoia sein."
200_1,1645180564,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,jan.boehm@wefox.com,,Re: Einladung Julian Teicke @START Summit 2022,"- Target Global wird eine zweite Session mit Julian am 25. machen.
    Soweit ich verstanden habe, hatten die beiden schon Kontakt diesbezüglich.


 Luciana's Assistentin hatte gefragt, ob es möglich wäre das Panel zwischen
12:00 - 13:00 anfangen zu lassen - Wäre das für Julian möglich?

 Du hattest bereits erwähnt, dass Julian am Nachmittag bereits Termin hat
und arbeiten muss. Wäre es dennoch möglich den Fireside Chat (25') im
Anschluss an das Panel (dh. zwischen 13:15 - 14:00) durchzuführen, oder ist
Julian's Kalender hier schon voll?

 Beste Grüsse und vielen Dank für deine Hilfe,
Tim

da Julian am 25. Nachmittags noch ein Paar Telefonate führen muss wird er
die Mentoring Sessions wohl leider nicht machen können:
Daran anschließend: ist es möglich, dass Julian einen Raum haben kann von
dem aus er nach dem Panel bis zu seiner Abreise arbeiten kann?
 Das wäre ganz toll!

 Seine Flüge und damit die genauen Zeiten habe ich noch nicht, aber
erfahrungsgemäß wird er den ein oder anderen Call noch vor Ort erledigen
wollen.

Alles klar, dass kann ich gerne so bei uns eintragen.

 Hier ist noch eine Info Page
mit
allen Infos zum Event. Wir werden hier alle relevanten Infos für Julian
eintragen. Sollte es zu größeren Änderungen kommen, gebe ich dir aber
natürlich per Mail Bescheid.

 Zusätzlich werden wir noch Ask-Me-Anything bzw. Mentoring Sessions machen.
 Das sind 30 minütige Sessions (meist direkt nach dem Panel/Fireside Chat
auf der Bühne) mit 10 Studenten und jungen Gründern, welche sich vorab mit
einer Frage bewerben müssen. Falls das für Julian interessant, ist müsste
er kurz dieses Typeform  (1')
ausfüllen.

 Beste Grüsse und einen guten Start in die Woche,

Europäischen Ökosystem

Hey Julian,
Ich hoffe du hattest einen guten Start ins neue Jahr. Ich habe bei START
für Nico übernommen, und er hat mir netterweise deinen Kontakt gegeben.
 Da dein Fireside Chat letztes Jahr so gut bei den Teilnehmenden angekommen
ist, würden wir dich für den *START Summit 2022 (24.-25.03.22)* gerne
wieder - diesmal in Person - einladen.

 Thema dieses Jahr ist ""* The World in 2042 - Bolder Founders. Better Future. *""
Zusammen mit Christian Miele wollen wir ein* Panel zum Europäischen Startup
Ökosystem *machen. Mögliche Themen/Fragen könnten sein:

   -
   - Talent in Europa und ESOP
   - Venture Capital Funding Situation in DE (angelehnt an den Bericht von
   Klaus Hommels zur deutschen Funding Gap)
   - Europäische Innovationskraft im internationalen Vergleich oder Europa
   als Epizentrum zukünftiger Innovation?

Wäre ein Panel mit Christian und einer weiteren Panelistin bspw. Judith
Dada oder Ann-Kristin Achleitner (tbd) für dich interessant?

Zusätzlich können wir auch gerne noch einen zweiten Fireside Chat machen
zum Thema der Rolle Mensches in der Gesellschaft von 2042 (o.ä. wie du es
bereits im OMR Podcast kurz erwähnt hattest).
 Natürlich würden wir uns freuen dich persönlich in St.Gallen begrüssen zu
können, solltest du aber lieber virtuell teilnehmen ist das auch eine
Option.

 Ich freue mich von dir zu hören.

 Beste Grüsse aus St.Gallen
Tim

To scale your growth, your options are even more limited. There are only four sources of self-sustaining long-term growth, aka growth engines:

 A common pitfall of early-stage startups is trying to invest in too many engines at once and not nail any. At scale, in order to win a market, you have to become world-class at your primary growth engine. To quote Dan Hockenmaier and myself from a post on this topic [ https://substack.com/redirect/02153112-19bf-43f8-a8c7-dcb163a9fec0?r=o1saq ]:
“Once you get to even moderate scale, each of these engines becomes highly competitive. 
 In the case of paid marketing and SEO, you are competing for a customer’s attention. Paid marketing becomes a business-model competition (who can turn this customer attention into enough value that they can bid more than anyone else for that attention), and SEO becomes a ranking-algorithm competition (who can capitalize on their content in such a way that ‘deciders’ like Google want to continue to send traffic their way).”
 Over time, most companies layer on an additional engine (usually paid growth, sometimes SEO) in order to continue to grow while their initial growth engine plateaus (learn about S-curves [ https://substack.com/redirect/55078d0b-aa98-4f02-bc0f-46fd1947ebb1?r=o1saq ] and adding layers to your cake [ https://substack.com/redirect/a437e306-262e-4a6e-b5e3-490ae6179f49?r=o1saq ]). But timing those investments correctly is critical, and that initial engine normally continues to drive the majority of your growth.
 Note, even though there are a limited set of strategies, there are infinite ways to be creative about how you execute each of them, e.g. Netflix infiltrating DVD forums, Hipcamp setting up tables outside REIs, Airbnb selling cereal.

 GTM motions of today’s biggest consumer apps
To bring it all together, here’s an overview of how today’s biggest consumer businesses kickstart their growth, and their primary growth engine. 
 A few stories I’ve gathered from founders and early employees describing their primary growth engines:
1. Virality (which can be driven by word of mouth, sharing content, sending invites to your friends, or a referral program)
Airbnb (WOM, referrals):
“If you look at the composition of growth of Airbnb, WOM was by far the biggest driver early on. Way over 50% on the guest side and way over 70% on the host side.” 
—Gustaf Alströmer [ https://substack.com/redirect/415420c1-8b6b-425c-ad5c-6bf8c1c170dd?r=o1saq ], first head of growth
Instacart (WOM, referrals):
“What showed up in our data was that we had strong word-of-mouth growth (people would report hearing about us from a friend, or they would use our referral program with their first order).”
—Max Mullen [ https://substack.com/redirect/5cf88969-9a64-49b9-8ff7-e8a550ac9bd4?r=o1saq ], co-founder
Udemy (WOM):
“Over 90% of our courses were created organically—which means word spread quickly. People started to realize the value of Udemy and clearly wanted to come.”
—Gagan Biyani [ https://substack.com/redirect/96614584-65a5-4d8c-9f54-55353772be0f?r=o1saq ], co-founder
Behance (WOM, sharing content):
“We had a year of deep focus on viral spread—syncing Twitter, FB, and other social media accounts to automate sharing every time a member posted a new project, new reasons to share projects even when they weren’t yours, and making sure our SEO game was solid.”
—Scott Belsky [ https://substack.com/redirect/c9d1c586-59a6-464e-a1a1-750736b77825?r=o1saq ], co-founder
Instagram (WOM, sharing content):
“When Instagram launched to the public on October 6, 2010, it immediately went viral. It reached number one in camera applications in the Apple app store.
 Within the first day, 25,000 people were using Instagram. Within the first week, it was 100,000, and [co-founder Kevin] Systrom had the surreal experience of seeing a stranger scrolling through the app on a San Francisco bus. He and [co-founder Mike] Krieger started an Excel spreadsheet that would update live with each user added.”

LinkedIn (inviting friends):
“The site launched on 5/5/03, and after a week we had something like 12.5K registered users ..."

Keep in mind, in the early days there were no public profiles or other ways to view the site as a non-registered user.
 LinkedIn deployed an Outlook contact uploader (very painful to build/support) to allow viral spread among professionals."

Pinduoduo (inviting friends):
“Pinduoduo’s model was simple: buy everyday items and receive discounts of up to 90% by completing in-app actions or inviting friends to buy them as well. Prices were set by suppliers, and a user’s very first purchase was almost always subsidized at a discount by PDD. Subsequent purchases could be made at the full price or discounted with a team or through in-app rewards. Users could join existing teams in the app, but prices were even lower if users started their own team. Early products were so cheap that there was very low friction to buy."

Booking.com:
“The founding company behind Booking.com actually started off as a meta-search business, and SEO was a growth driver early on. But eventually, growth started to level off because we were doing some gray-hat stuff and Google started to penalize us.
 So we began exploring new ways to grow. At the time, Google was taking off like a rocket ship, and the users had so much purchase intent while searching. We thought, if we could get good at Google, we’d do really well. We thought—what if we try AdWords?

Two bonus growth engines just for marketplaces and platforms: Sales, and Supply driving demand
Sales
As I noted above, sales is rarely an effective growth engine for B2C startups—with the exception of marketplaces and platforms, where the supply is incredibly valuable. In those cases, sales is both an important kickstarting tactic and an important part of the overall growth strategy.

 Some percentage of instructors reply to the email.
 Udemy team member gets on the phone/Skype/email and helps the instructor understand the benefits, answer questions, etc.

Supply driving demand
You’ll notice in the table above there’s an additional growth engine, “Supply drives demand,” that again exists only for marketplaces and platform startups. How this works is within a marketplace, your supply (e.g. DoorDash restaurants, Substack writers, Eventbrite event organizers) often drive their customers/audience to your site because it benefits them (e.g. restaurants tell customers to order from DoorDash, writers drive people to Substack to subscribe, event organizers send everyone their Eventbrite ticketing page). Although technically this is a growth engine, and an incredibly powerful one, it won’t be the source of your growth because you still need to grow the supply in the first place (usually through sales), and there isn’t a ton you can do to accelerate this engine. But when you do have this engine in place, lean into it big-time because it creates an incredible unfair advantage.
 A few examples of this engine in action:
DoorDash:
“Restaurants did a lot of the marketing for us."

222_1,1657302557,chamath@getrevue.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What I read this week... (plus some thoughts on markets),"By Chamath Palihapitiya • Issue #9 • View online
Some random thoughts on the forgotten importance of oil on markets…




I’ve been trying to make more sense of what’s been happening in the global economy, equity markets, energy markets, etc. over the past few weeks, so I thought it’d be useful to write down some current thoughts. Since Russia invaded Ukraine more than four months ago, Putin’s strongest weapon has become his stranglehold over Europe’s oil and gas supply. It’s becoming increasingly clear that each day we fail to take action to increase the energy supply in Europe is a day that Putin gets stronger. Let me explain…At the moment, people across Europe are enjoying a nice warm summer, but governments across the continent are already focused on winter, which is when energy supply will become an even bigger problem. As people begin to need to heat their homes, they will need even more oil and gas. "
222_2,1657302557,chamath@getrevue.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What I read this week... (plus some thoughts on markets),"According to Goldman Sachs, 3Q22 global oil supply vs. demand is at a surplus of +300K barrels/day at $110/barrel. But, if Russia follows through on its threats and cuts supply by 3M barrels per day (bpd), the supply-demand goes negative to (-2.7M) bpd. At these levels, prices could soar to $175-200+/bbl. At a 5M bpd cut, the price of oil could approach $400/bbl."
222_3,1657302557,chamath@getrevue.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What I read this week... (plus some thoughts on markets),These prices would single-handedly send inflation meaningfully higher and force central banks around the world to crush demand by increasing rates aggressively.
222_4,1657302557,chamath@getrevue.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What I read this week... (plus some thoughts on markets),"The fact is that Europe simply doesn’t have enough oil and gas supply ex-Russia to meet the necessary demand going into winter. Saudi Arabia says that they will ramp their production capacity from 10M to 11M bpd, but they’ve never actually produced consistently at this level for any extended period of time. And if the Saudis can’t sustain these supply levels, there’ll be major price implications (again, see above).This is why oil (i.e. the war in Ukraine) remains one of the key drivers of inflation and an early “canary in the coal mine” for interest rate policy. Because of the precarious situation with oil and gas, combined with the growing food, housing, and labor shortages, I’m worried we will likely see inflation elevated well into 2023 regardless of how aggressively the Fed hikes rates in the near-term or whatever political moves Biden or Congress make. The Taylor Rule (which tries to find the equilibrium between interest rates and inflation) already shows that we are dramatically below the equilibrium rate (current interest rate is 1.75% vs. equilibrium rate of 5.7%), which means we’ll need another +400 bps (!) of interest rate increases to bring supply-demand into balance. This would have obvious (read negative) implications for the equity and debt markets. Buying becomes more expensive and corporate default rates will rise – notwithstanding the obvious impact on everyday consumers. The bottom line is that European governments are starting to acknowledge the need to wrest back energy control. And some utilities are even contemplating either paying their customers NOT to use energy, or calling for governments to impose price caps or quotas. "
222_5,1657302557,chamath@getrevue.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What I read this week... (plus some thoughts on markets),"At the end of the day, no matter how many weapons are sent to Ukraine or how much “pressure” is put on Putin, he’s got his hand on Europe’s energy spigot which means he’s got his fist over the global economy. And until we put forth a pragmatic energy strategy, Russia will have an outsized impact on oil prices over the next few years and thus inflation, interest rates, and asset prices as well."

ZIPLINE'S PROMISEFORMER TESLA CFO JOINS THE DRONE DELIVERY STARTUP
A disruptor that's been relatively quiet in recent months is back in the headlines: drone delivery startup Zipline, which ranked No. 29 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.  The Silicon Valley robotics company announced that former Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja will join its leadership team as chief business officer and CFO at the end of this month.  Ahuja served as the CFO of Tesla from March 2017 to March 2019, but he first joined the company in 2008. He was with Tesla when it went public in 2010 and briefly left the company in 2015. 
"
230_1,1663275191,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,An old Tesla hand taking flight?,"“Rarely do I see this level of disruption and impact paired with the world-class technology that Zipline’s team is building,” Ahuja said in a release. “It’s an exciting time for Zipline, and I’m thrilled to join the team as we keep building to offer these solutions at a massive scale.” 
 Drone delivery has become a hot topic as companies look to reach the point of near-instant e-commerce shopping, while also avoiding some of the issues that have snarled last-mile delivery in recent years such as traffic, lack of available drivers, and gas prices.  Zipline's focus in this arms race? The delivery of critical medical supplies. 
 Since its founding in 2014, the company has established itself in Ghana and Rwanda, helping to power their national blood delivery network and Covid-19 vaccine distribution, respectively. In March, the company announced it helped the Ghana Ministry of Health deliver one million vaccines, an effort that not only shortened vaccine stockouts but also increased the types of medicines and supplies available at health facilities by 10%.  Last November, Zipline marked the first time it delivered something directly to consumers’ homes as part of a partnership with Walmart. In the Pea Ridge, Arkansas area, residents can place orders online for a variety of health and wellness products and have them delivered by Zipline’s autonomous aircraft on the same day.  Walmart has been testing how the small, unmanned aircraft could change the game for retail, drive e-commerce growth and turn its stores into a way to outmatch Amazon on speed. 
 In their attempt to do so, a 25-foot platform built behind the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Pea Ridge serves as the base for the take-off and landing of Zipline’s 11-foot wide, fixed-wing drones which operate autonomously. After a customer orders a product through the Zipline app, a Walmart associate picks and packs the product and gives it to the Zipline staff. The drone is then loaded and launched and the product is dropped off in a cardboard box that is supported by a paper parachute.  With the larger network of sites, Walmart will be able to deliver over 1 million packages by drone in a year, David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart U.S., previously said.  One of the surprises of the drone tests has been what customers order. Walmart anticipated customers would use the drones to get emergency items, such as over-the-counter medication, Guggina said."
230_2,1663275191,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,An old Tesla hand taking flight?,"Instead, he said, many have used it for convenience. At one store, for instance, the top seller for drone delivery is Hamburger Helper.  Other frequent items delivered by drone are batteries, trash bags, laundry detergent and Welch’s fruit snacks. 
 Still, the anticipated rise in flight automation that would reveal new use cases — and give rise to new markets like the widespread delivery of critical medical supplies — have to overcome a major headwind: regulation. 
 The permissions the drone industry needs to fly beyond the line of sight, to fly at night, over people, and to break the 1-to-1 ratio, all at scale rather than in a test phase, still haven’t been realized more than a decade later, despite approvals in recent years to fly beyond the line of visual sight. 
 The economic implications of that mean this issue will be perhaps the foremost challenge facing Ahuja when he joins Zipline on September 30.

 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
 LOOKING BACK AT THE INAUGURAL LIST, 10 YEARS LATER... THIS WEEK: TUMBLRTumblr — the short form, multi-media blogging platform, that in many ways defined the online sensibilities of a coming-of-age generation — turned 15 this year.
  Despite recent years of waning users and declining cultural relevance, 2022 has offered a glimpse into the platform's hope for re-cultivated popularity and significance, as new leadership leans into the ethos of creativity that first begat the platform.
 In 2007, after stumbling upon a microblog called Projectionist, which tracked together tumblelogs — a blog variation that favors short-form, mixed-media posts over longer editorial posts — Tumblr co-founder David Karp became fascinated with this alternative to traditional blogging. He paused his software consulting endeavor and focused on creating his own tumbleblog platform — which he subsequently named, Tumblr.
  Celebrities, such as Frank Ocean and Taylor Swift, flocked to the site to interact with fans, and entire fandoms centered around television shows and musical artists took shape, and a distinctly Tumblr aesthetic, one that characterized the digital sensibilities of the mid 2010's, began to emerge.   Shortly after making CNBC's very first Disruptor 50 list in 2013, Yahoo acquired Tumblr for a then-staggering $1.1 billion, with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer promising, ""not to screw it up. ""  But Yahoo was later faced with an undeniable reality — the fact that Tumblr had never really managed to become profitable.

Organizations can leverage the latest AI-based tools to better detect threats and protect their systems and data resources. But cyber criminals can also use the technology to launch more sophisticated attacks.  The rise in cyberattacks is helping to fuel growth in the market for AI-based security products. A July 2022 report by Acumen Research and Consulting says the global market was $14.9 billion in 2021 and is estimated to reach $133.8 billion by 2030.

 When combined with stolen personal information or collected open source data such as social media posts, cyber criminals can use AI to create large numbers of phishing emails to spread malware or collect valuable information. 
 “Security experts have noted that AI-generated phishing emails actually have higher rates of being opened — [for example] tricking possible victims to click on them and thus generate attacks — than manually crafted phishing emails,” said Brian Finch, co-leader of the cybersecurity, data protection & privacy practice at law firm Pillsbury Law. “AI can also be used to design malware that is constantly changing, to avoid detection by automated defensive tools.”

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

als Borussia Dortmund am 31. Oktober 2000 für elf Euro je Aktie an die
Börse ging, zählte ein Kumpel von mir zu den ersten Investoren. Von
seinem Konfirmationsgeld kaufte er sich damals Dortmund-Aktien.

 Sagen wir mal"

des großen, durch die Covid-Pandemie angeheizten Trading-Hypes, haben
auch in der Blockchain viele Investor:innen das schnelle und vor allem
einfache Geld gesucht - und vermutlich sehr selten gefunden. Angeheizt
wurde die Get-Rich-Quick-FOMO durch zahlreiche enorm reichweitenstarke
Promis; mittels Werbung oder eigener Tokens. Welche Stars sich wie am

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN  

⚽️⚾️ Warum die New York Yankees beim AC Mailand einsteigen

Wer beim Börsengang von Borussia Dortmund am 31. Oktober 2000
investiert hat, dürfte sein Investment bis heute bereuen. Denn den
Ausgabekurs von elf Euro hat die Aktie nie wieder erreicht. Aktuell
dümpelt sie bei unter vier Euro. In Deutschland haben Investoren
bislang eher das Nachsehen, weil die sogenannte 50+1-Regel vorschreibt,
dass die Stimmenmehrheit bei den Vereinen verbleiben muss. Doch auch
hierzulande wird um dieses Modell gerungen.

 In Italien wollen US-Investoren hingegen in den traditionsreichen AC
Mailand investieren. 

Was steckt dahinter? Fußball-Vereine haben oft Millionen Fans - und
damit einen hohen Markenwert, speziell wenn es sich um die jeweiligen
Top-Clubs eines Landes handelt, die (im Idealfall) auch noch
regelmäßig in der Champions League zu sehen sind. Beim 19-fachen
italienischen Meister AC Mailand sollen nun offenbar die New York
Yankees einsteigen (bzw. der Investment-Arm des Baseball-Clubs) sowie
ein weiterer US-Investor. Das berichtet die Financial Times (Paywall).
 Die
Private-Equity-Gesellschaft Red Bird Capital Partners hat sie offenbar
an Bord geholt, um den Club für insgesamt 1,2 Milliarden Euro zu
übernehmen. Red Bird ist auch schon am englischen Club FC Liverpool
beteiligt. 

Was bringt das? Aktuell gibt es erstaunlich wenige börsennotierte
Fußball-Clubs. Der BVB gehört dazu, der Viertligist Unterhaching und
auch der englische Club Manchester United. Alle drei sind an der Börse
von früheren Höchstkursen weit entfernt. Trotzdem haben sich zuletzt
sehr viele Investoren in Fußball-Clubs eingekauft - allein in der
Premier League wechselten zuletzt der FC Chelsea (gezwungenermaßen) und
Newcastle United den Besitzer
.
 Auch beim AC Mailand hoffen die Investoren auf einen deutlichen
Wertzuwachs, indem sie den Club wieder erfolgreicher machen und der
Marke neue Strahlkraft verleihen. Im OMR Podcast haben OMR-Gründer
Philipp Westermeyer und Stammgast Sven Schmidt am Beispiel Manchester
United diskutiert, warum das Investment trotz niedrigem Aktienkurs
lukrativ gewesen sein dürfte für die Investoren.

 Die Bundesliga jedenfalls will"
232_3,1661865437,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,"Promis, bleibt bei euren Leisten","sich auch für Private-Equity-Investoren
öffnen - und plant, einen Anteil an den Medienrechten zu verkaufen
.

‍ ⚖️ Newsbites: Formel 1, FTC, Twitter

Krypto-Pläne: Promi-NFTs liefen zuletzt alles andere als erfolgreich
(siehe Artikel des Tages) .
 Dennoch plant die Formel 1 mit Blick auf den Grand Prix in Las Vegas im
kommenden Jahr den Einstieg ins NFT- und Krypto-Game.

 FTC-Klage: Die US-Handelsbehörde FTC hat den Datenhändler Kochava
verklagt. Dieser handelt mit Daten von Millionen Smartphones. Die
Bundesbehörde argumentiert, dass durch den Datenhandel Frauen verfolgt
werden könnten, die eine Abtreibung vornehmen lassen.

 Twitter-Enthüllung: Ein Whistleblower hat Details über den Umgang mit
Fake-Accounts und Co. bei Twitter enthüllt - kein Wunder, dass Elon
Musk da hellhörig wird. Die Anwälte des Milliardärs wollen nun
offenbar Kontakt mit dem Whistleblower aufnehmen

 In early July, a startup called Synchron [https://substack.com/redirect/104378f9-4232-48cb-b90f-11e378780507?u@394114] implanted a device into the brain of a patient with ALS that will let the patient use the internet, text, and email, just by thinking. This is sci-fi happening in real-time, and benefiting people afflicted with crippling diseases first. Synchron has already implanted devices in Australian patients, and there’s a long way to go before we live in the world Tim Urban described in Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future"

Brie Wolfson in Every
It’s more about missing that universal agreement that it’s really, really cool to devote yourself fully to your work. And to expect that from your colleagues in a way that makes you feel that “we’re all really, really, really in this together” kind of way.
 Over the weekend, I started writing a piece, inspired by The Bear [https://substack.com/redirect/33a5a0e8-56a8-4e7b-adea-9ba5e46024a1?u@394114], about the importance of working really hard and giving a shit about the quality of your work. 
 Simply put: achieving great things — like building Stripe, running a world-class restaurant, or pulling off anything that we’ve linked to in Weekly Dose of Optimism — requires passion bordering on obsession and a boatload of hours. 
 Wolfson’s piece is a celebration of the magic that comes from being a part of a team that’s working incredibly hard together and a good reminder that great progress requires great effort.

Hi Florian,
ich hoffe dir geht es gut! :)

 Wie bei unserem letzten Treffen Anfang Juli schon besprochen sind wir im Content Team mittlerweile tief mit dem Topic beschäftigt.
 Ich wollte fragen, ob wir gegen Ende nächster Woche/Anfang August einen Call machen, bei welchem wir auf unsere

  1.   jetzigen Ergebnisse eingehen, und
  2.   Feedback und Impulse von dir einholen können.

 Zu dem Zeitpunkt haben wir schon ein:

  1.   Thema (um welches sich das Topic drehen wird)
  2.   Ideen zum Wording
Natürlich ist nichts final, da wir natürlich dein Feedback einarbeiten wollen.

 Wann würde es dir am besten passen? Wir sind relativ flexibel, aufgrund von Lukas passen uns Donnerstage und Freitage am besten.
 Falls der Zeitraum passt, würde ich mit Vera separat einen Slot ausfindig machen.

 Wir freuen uns schon.

""EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A PART OF THIS""WHY CLIMATE-FOCUSED STARTUPS ARE THE NEXT COOL THING
The $369 billion investment in climate and energy policies as part of the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act not only represents the biggest investment in U.S. history to fight climate change but perhaps the biggest opportunity yet for investment in the booming clean energy, clean manufacturing, and clean innovation sector.
 
"
244_1,1660861209,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Green is good,That should further bolster an area that was already seeing a massive uptick in investment.

A record $1.4 billion was invested into climate and carbon-focused startups in the second quarter of this year, up nearly 47% year-over-year, according to CB Insights.
 
 The inclusion of companies like electric tractor manufacturer Monarch Tractor, sustainable construction materials company CarbonCure Technologies, and urban infrastructure-focused climate tech company BlocPower in this year’s CNBC Disruptor 50 list is also a reflection of the growth of this space, joining other recently included green-focused companies like AMP Robotics and Footprint, who are both disrupting recycling in different ways.

244_4,1660861209,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Green is good,"“Everybody wants to be part of this,” Carmichael Roberts, co-leader of the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate fund founded by Bill Gates, told CNBC’s Diana Olick this week. “The calls that I’m getting now — tremendous, already, and there was already a big groundswell around climate, but this just really boosted even further.” Roberts said the ability to manufacture in the United States, thanks to tax breaks and other incentives, is “transformative” for startups and will only increase entrepreneurship. He noted that this level of government investment in climate initiatives and innovation will give private investors even more confidence in the climate space.  “I bet you there’s somewhere between 300 to 1,000 companies that will exist now because of this bill that would not have existed,” said Roberts. 
 BlocPower CEO Donnel Baird told Olick that the Act not only “dramatically lowers the cost to building owners and homeowners of clean energy upgrades,” but also “creates a new Green Bank to provide flexible capital to clean energy projects that Wall Street can leverage.” 
BlocPower, which has raised more than $100 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, had previously announced in February 2021 a $50 million financing solution with Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group to offer small- and medium-sized building owners structured financial products that would cover the installation and maintenance of the company’s air source heat pumps. The company also offers institutional investors and corporations Environmental Justice Impact Green Bonds.
  CarbonCure CEO Robert Niven wrote in a statement that the Act is a “momentous legislation that will bring the U.S. closer to its climate goals than any other previous climate and energy policy.” 
 Niven also noted it includes “major funding for programs, tools and innovations needed to accelerate our energy transition,” adding that the Act also will leverage “the massive purchasing power of the federal government to accelerate the industry’s transition to sustainable building materials and construction practices.” 
Ron Hovsepian, CEO of four-time Disruptor 50 company Indigo Ag, told Olick that “The proposed $20 billion commitment [in agriculture subsidies] would enable farmers to plant the seeds for a meaningful, long-term and durable climate solution.” 
 With those in the industry more bullish than ever, that should only further investment into climate- and green-focused companies, surfacing more and more disruptive startups and ideas. 
 “The venture capital dollars will flow in a lot faster from areas that may not have been investing in an area, but now all of a sudden, see, wow, we’re going to have a real path to scale with the best and the brightest people, and the best companies being created."
244_5,1660861209,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Green is good,"That’s what this bill overall does,” Roberts told Olick.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?LOOKING BACK AT THE INAUGURAL LIST, 10 YEARS LATER... THIS WEEK: WHATSAPP
Following the launch of the iPhone in 2009, Former Yahoo! employees Brian Acton and Jan Koum had the idea to create an app that would allow users to update statuses on their contact list, which would then signal to their contacts where they were, or what they were up to at the moment. Koum recruited the services of iPhone developer Igor Solomennikov, and they created their first prototype.
  Among its first users, however, the app proved to be unpopular, and was riddled with connectivity issues and crashes. It was beginning to look like a failed concept, and Koum debated abandoning the project altogether and pivoting to a different job.  
 But then, Apple launched push notifications, and that changed everything for what is now the most popular messaging app worldwide — WhatsApp.

Fiber-based networks make up the majority of the internet’s backbone. Fiber-optic subsea cables spanning thousands of miles connect continents together, exchanging data at nearly the speed of light. Meanwhile, the massive data centers that host all of our cloud-based applications also rely on fiber connections. Increasingly, these fiber connections are making their way directly into peoples’ homes, providing them with fast, reliable internet."

 The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed in November 2021 promises to bridge this digital divide, with $65 billion dedicated to expanding access to broadband internet to all Americans. Such government support, along with a number of other factors, have caused a spike in the demand for fiber products. 
 To understand the technology behind fiber-optic internet and how the market for fiber products is changing, CNBC visited Corning’s optical fiber and cable manufacturing facilities in North Carolina. Most famous as the maker of Gorilla Glass for iPhones, Corning is also the world’s largest producer of optical fiber by manufacturing capacity and market share, as well as the largest manufacturer of fiber cable in North America. In Q2 2022, Corning disclosed that the optical communications business was its largest segment by revenue, reaching sales of $1.3 billion.

BUILD OR BUYTHE SHUTDOWN OF AMAZON CARE IS AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN DISRUPTION
Chalk up another failure in health care for Amazon, one of the ultimate market disruptors.  First, its much-hyped effort with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to reform health care, Haven, ended its short life. 
 Now, Amazon Care, its effort to tackle telemedicine and primary care for the employer market on a national basis – which Amazon itself trumpeted as gaining more and more clients – is being shut down.
 Is that all the proof we needed of what many people have said over the years: health care is just harder to disrupt than most industries? 
"
251_1,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,Maybe not.
251_2,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"The shutdown of Amazon Care may come back to a simple choice that companies, especially those with a lot of cash, have to make when it comes to breaking into new markets: build or buy. 
 For some health care industry watchers, it’s no surprise at all that Amazon Care is going away as a stand-alone entity. When Amazon made the decision in July to acquire primary care company One Medical, which does what Amazon Care wanted to do, it was the writing on the wall that something was going to change. 
 And for a cash-rich company looking for opportunities to buy into a stock market that had pushed down the value of recently public health companies – One Medical had traded as high as $58 in 2021 and Amazon bought it for $18 a share – Amazon may have been more opportunistic than anything else in staking the next stage of its future in health care on One Medical.  “It’s not surprising they’re shutting it down,” said Sari Kaganoff, general manager of consulting at Rock Health, which invests as a VC in health start-ups and has a health advisory and research arm."
251_3,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"“Their vision always was to have a primary care integrated solution and now it will have a better solution than what they could build,” Kaganoff said. 
"
251_4,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"It was a little surprising, maybe, that Amazon announced the shutdown before the One Medical deal even closed, but One Medical has many more markets, many more offices and many more companies that are clients than Amazon ever did (it had to boast about signing up Whole Foods, which it owns, as a client for Amazon Care). Maybe also surprising: it didn’t wait to rebrand One Medical as Amazon Care."
251_5,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"PillPack, its acquisition in the pharmacy space, held on for a few years before ultimately becoming Amazon Pharmacy.
 
 By Amazon’s own account, it was a failure, at least in the terms conveyed in the internal memo provided to the press about the shuttering. There's no doubt it struggled with the problem of building up an in-person care component. While telemedicine is a nice have, it’s not a full health-care solution, and Amazon would have had to ramp up investment considerably to build a true national hybrid health-care practice with sites and physicians and clinics.
  In the end, let’s say Amazon Care was a test run for a business, and once Amazon learned enough to know what it wanted in the long-term, it bought the better company at a time when its value was depressed. 
 “I don’t think they failed, because One Medical is great,” Kaganoff said. “Amazon Care was no different than any other stand-alone health startup in terms of needing to be consolidated,” adding that, “They played around with it a bit.” 
"
251_6,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"Though past Disruptor 50 lists included companies focused on Amazon Care's original aim, telemedicine, this year's list showed companies focused on tackling much more precise health-care challenges, such as kidney care, diabetes, clinical trial enrollment and pharmacy infrastructure. 
 Still, there was at least one direct link to the history of our annual Disruptor 50 list, as well as a potential casualty in the Amazon Care news: two weeks ago the juggernaut signed a deal with Headspace Health, a 2013 Disruptor 50 company, for mental health care services. 
 While Amazon’s healthcare efforts in recent years have been associated with direct battles (i.e., Amazon Care vs. Teladoc), Wall Street analysts have said the market should worry more about Amazon making a string of acquisitions that speak to broader aims."
251_7,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"That seems to still be happening. 
"
251_8,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"Amazon doesn’t seem to be done yet pushing its cash around in buying more in health-care, with it in recent headlines as reportedly among bidders for Signify Health, which has an overlap with the Iora Health business of One Medical, focused on a more complicated, Medicare-centric market than standard national care practices.
 
 Between One Medical and Signify Health, it’s clear Amazon still plans to be a formidable player in the health-care space. It can leverage its ability to personalize its offerings, connect to its pharmacy, and ultimately pose a threat to many other retail giants aiming to upend healthcare. Walmart acquired telehealth company MeMD in 2021; CVS, which already offers telemedicine through a deal with Amwell, is another rumored bidder for Signify; and Walgreens has VillageMD and is opening up hundreds of offices in markets around the country.
  That retail disruption is only going to grow, for a simple reason: When you look at the share of wallet of everyone, from consumers to employers, the health-care market is a big part of spending. Amazon is already in almost every other chunk of the wallet, except maybe banking (though it has credit cards).  What’s the big chunk of the market they are not in? 
"
251_9,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"“It’s healthcare, and they already have so many things consumer-health oriented, it just makes sense to go big in health care,” Kaganoff said. 
 When Haven debuted to much fanfare, people thought the combined might of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan and Amazon could result in a significant driving down of costs throughout the health-care system that Warren Buffett has called a tapeworm on the national economy."
251_10,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"But it’s as much about something else for Amazon and its rivals. 
"
251_11,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"“I think it’s just market share,” Kaganoff said. 
"
251_12,1661464269,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Was Amazon Care a failure?,"As Amazon moves from primary care, into more complicated care, and potentially even chronic care – and combines pharmacy and over-the-counter medication with all its offerings – everyone from private health start-ups to Teladoc to retail competitors and health-care incumbents should continue to worry. Amazon Care’s failure may have come at a cost and may not have been messageD as elegantly as Amazon wanted, but what it ultimately is buying and building off may make it the stronger disruptor.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?LOOKING BACK AT THE INAUGURAL LIST, 10 YEARS LATER... THIS WEEK: TWITTER
Today, Twitter is ubiquitous — it says it has more than 200 million active daily users and the content published on its platform undeniably shapes culture, politics, and popular discourse across the world. 
 But in 2006, Twitter was nothing more than a rough idea from then-New York University student Jack Dorsey. Dorsey, who was working at the podcasting startup Oedo at the time, pitched the idea to his colleagues of creating an SMS service that would allow users to publicly communicate with an entire community, rather than privately to one person, like traditional messaging. 
 The idea resonated with the Odeo team, and was then further developed by Dorsey and Noah Glass. A year in, Odeo founder Evan Williams told investors that the startup was pivoting its focus to Twitter, rather than podcasting, and hoping to save investors a loss, offered to buy back Odeo's stock. 
 Investors have since speculated if Williams knew more about Twitter's potential than he let on at the time, but nonetheless, they agreed. 
 At first, Twitter attracted little attention, but after the team attended the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive conference, where they recieved broad praises, the platform's usage tripled overnight — and Twitter established itself as a leading force in the emerging social media landscape. 
 Since then, discouraging earnings and an ongoing legal battle has not helped the already skittish state of platform advertisers, who have historically generated most of Twitter's revenue but have decreased spending amid recent economic uncertainty.

 Over the past 20 years, 85% of newly named S&P 500 company CEOs came from four roles: chief operating officer, divisional CEO, chief financial officer, or a second-layer management position leading a large business unit, according to data from executive search consulting firm Spencer Stuart. 
 But as the importance of staying ahead of the curve on technology and at the forefront of digital transformation has increased since the start of the pandemic, recent appointments suggest companies are starting to look at technology leaders as potential chief executives.

wir dich beim START Summit 22 begrüssen durften und du dazu beigetragen
hast, dass der Summit so ein grosser Erfolg war.

 Alle Teilnehmer, mit denen ich nach deinem Fireside Chat mit Lucas (an der

 Let’s get right to it. After reviewing the early growth strategies of more than 100 consumer companies, it turns out that there are really only seven reliable ways to find your first 1,000 users:
Reach out to friends and colleagues
Reach out to targeted strangers
Go where your target audience hangs out (online or offline)
Enlist influencers (paid or organically)
Get press
Create viral content
Get physical placement (e.g. flyers, stickers, signs)
You can think of this list as a menu of options for kickstarting your product’s growth:

 How do you decide which tactic to pursue?
To make your decision even easier, here’s what I’ve found to be the three common archetypes of early startup growth:
Typical path to first 1,000 users for consumer startups:
Reach out to friends and colleagues (e.g. email them, post on social media, call them)
Go where your target audience hangs out, online or offline (e.g. forums, Product Hunt, college campuses, Craigslist, etc.)
 Enlist influencers
If you’re a marketplace or platform (e.g. DoorDash, Cameo, Substack):
Reach out to targeted strangers (e.g. DM celebs, email owners)
Get physical placement (e.g. stickers, flyers)
Enable your supply to drive your demand
If you have a remarkable story to tell (e.g. Airbnb, Spotify, Superhuman):
Get press
Try to create viral content
Below I’ll share dozens of stories from founders pursuing each of these tactics, but broadly, here’s a summary of which tactics were most impactful for all of the largest consumer tech companies:

How to find your first 1,000 users
Strategy 1: Reach out to friends and colleagues
The easiest and fastest way to find your early users, and a large driver of early growth for about 20% of startups, is to reach out to your friends and former colleagues.
 There’s little downside to giving this a shot, but just don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t bear fruit, as your friends may not be anything like your super-specific who.

But they also built a feature into the site whereby users could invite people, and soon their friends from Facebook were summoning people from other startups, and other entrepreneurs.”

Strategy 2: Reach out to targeted strangers
The second most common way to acquire your first 1,000 users, important for the early growth of 30% of consumer startups, is to go recruit them directly, either through email, DMs, phone calls, or door to door. Interestingly, this tactic was almost exclusively used by marketplace startups to bootstrap the supply side and rarely used by non-marketplaces. I imagine this is because one unit of supply is worth a lot to a new marketplace, and so the ROI on this manual cold outreach is high enough.

Cameo (supply side): DMs

Shef (supply side): Intros from friends
“We began by serving immigrant communities in the Bay Area—allowing them to easily share extremely authentic dishes that couldn’t be found at local restaurants. What we didn’t realize at the time was the enormous value in targeting these tight-knit communities, who share many cultural traditions, including food. 
 We found our first shefs by asking where our friends were purchasing their authentic dishes, then onboarded those shefs. They had their favorite neighborhood cooks who they were already ordering from (usually using WhatsApp or WeChat), and many of these folks were also on FB Groups (of that specific immigrant community). We asked for intros, and joined these groups.”

“We ventured to build a marketplace for this apparently underserved niche, and while doing so we became familiar with Craftster.org (which at the time was another message board consisting of around 100,000 people). We reached out to Craftster’s founder [Leah Kramer] and suddenly we had an audience with an even larger group of interested sellers.
 By the time we launched the site (roughly two months after conception), we had thousands of sellers excited to register and try it out. The ball started rolling almost immediately (especially since we offered fee-free listing for the first few months while we built a billing system).”

 The following Monday, I went to all the sororities and fraternities at USC. I started with the sororities at the Monday night chapter meetings. I stood in line to make an announcement. My pitch was: ‘Do any of you have any crushes on anyone at school, and are you too afraid to go up to them and strike up a conversation? Do you have someone in a class you kind of want to get to know but don’t know if they feel the same way? Are you nervous that someone you like, doesn’t like you back? Do you feel like you’re seeing the same people every day and want to see new faces around here?"

 Next we went to the fraternities, I would run, not walk, from house to house saying the same exact thing: ‘Who wants to find out who likes you on campus? Who wants to see a ton of new faces? Where are the sorority girls on campus? They are on Tinder. It’s not creepy, this is the new thing.’

Strategy 4: Enlist influencers, paid or organically
A powerful yet underutilized way to get your early users is to enlist influencers to talk about your product, either by paying them or just by getting them excited about it. Influencers, if you think about it, are people who influence others (duh!), so your job is to figure out who your super-specific who are influenced by, and enlist them in your growth plan."

Key: Getting the influencer genuinely excited about what you’re building
Takeaway question: What’s at the center of the Venn diagram of (1) who your super-specific who is influenced by and (2) which of them you can get excited about what you’re building?
 Some examples of this tactic in action:
Instagram
“I think the biggest thing overall was that as we were prototyping and testing [Instagram], we gave it to a few folks who had a very large Twitter following. Not necessarily a large following overall, but a very large following within a specific community—specifically, the designer community, the online web design community. We felt that photography and the visual element of what we were doing really resonated with those people."

“This is the day-by-day chart for the initial launch. The first public mention of the service I can find is on [co-founder] Evan Williams’s blog late on July 13th, but you can see that even on the 12th there was a mini-boom in registrations. Then Om Malik’s post on the 15th [https://substack.com/redirect/e72091a4-2509-456e-a948-3310ba20d0c4?u@394114] really pushed it over the top, with more than 250 people signing up the next day. What I find fascinating is that there were less than 600 people on the service at that point, so it was a very prescient plug. […]
A recurring theme is the power of that initial publicity in driving the early users, and the feeling that it was a way to connect with an interesting group of people. Evan’s high profile and Om’s endorsement must have been a big help in building that sort of buzz.”

 Key: Having the skill and connections to get a reporter interested

As ridiculous as it sounds, the coverage by these bottom-feeder press was the social proof that more-prominent publications needed to piggyback on the story. Eventually, national news networks, including NBC and CBS, were interviewing the founders of the unknown startup that was housing the biggest political convention in history.
 The DNC bump was great for business, but it only lasted a week. The founders were desperate for a way to extend the impact of the event. While sitting around their kitchen table one day, still extremely broke, they came up with the idea that would bring Airbnb to profitability: cereal.
 Both designers who graduated from the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, the pair created fictitious cereals called ‘Obama O’s, the Cereal of Change’ and ‘Cap’n McCain’s, a Maverick in Every Box.’ They designed the box artwork themselves and convinced a student at U.C.

Duolingo
“Before Duolingo launched as a website, we had a splash page where people could sign up to be invited to the private beta. The splash page had a very clear message: unlike other language-learning software that costs hundreds of dollars, Duolingo would be 100% free and therefore accessible to everybody. 
 At around that time, Luis [von Ahn], our CEO, gave this TED talk [https://substack.com/redirect/0ec36938-fe9c-49dc-a16a-d574f0b79005?u@394114] about the idea for Duolingo in 2011, which went viral."

Strategy 7: Get physical placement
And finally, a strategy used primarily by food delivery and dating startups (and only about 10% of the startups I looked at) is putting flyers, stickers, and signs where your super-specific who spends time—essentially, getting in front of your super-specific who’s eyes as they go about their day.
 Ideal for: Products that require customers to be local (e.g. food delivery, dating)
Key: Hustle
Takeaway question: If you could put flyers, stickers, or signs somewhere, where would you?
 Some stories of this tactic in action:
DoorDash
“What we learned about our customers is that they didn’t care about DoorDash; they cared about the restaurant. So what we did was was print out tens of thousands of flyers that said ‘Dubar delivers, get hummus delivered!’"

Reach out to friends and colleagues
Reach out to targeted strangers
Go where your target audience hangs out (online or offline)
Enlist influencers (paid or organically)
Get press

“Help came from Apple when it launched push notifications in June 2009, letting developers ping users when they weren’t using an app. Jan [Koum] updated WhatsApp so that each time you changed your status—‘Can’t talk, I’m at the gym’—it would ping everyone in your network.

272_3,1665068899,myclimatejourney@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Sustainable packaging alternatives with Shellworks,"But as sustainability continues to gain awareness in the popular conscience, how far away are we from celebrating companies who create small footprints from their packaging? How do you celebrate something if the goal is for it not to be noticeable in the first place? 
 Shellworks is developing sustainable packaging alternatives to plastic that don't compromise on performance or aesthetic. Based in the UK, the company recently raised a seed round of funding to help them scale their micro based mono-material packaging via cosmetics companies that are looking for natural packaging alternatives. Insiya brings a no-compromises spirit to what she's doing at Shellworks. She believes her company can develop packaging that has minimal footprint and is stunning and brand-forward.
  In this conversation, Cody and Insiya cover her background, the state of plastic packaging today, how Shellworks came to be, their initial approach to product development, current product lines and traction, and how their non-compromising culture turns internal innovations into a robust product pipeline.

277_0,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"""Why did you leave VC?""

It's a question that I get a lot.

 So let me tell you how and why I made that move -- smack in the
middle of our last global recession.

"
277_1,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"Background

I joined L Capital Partners a couple of months after I finished
business school."
277_2,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"The fund (the firm's first) started making
investments in 2005.

"
277_3,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"By the time I had joined it was 2008 - and the fund was mostly
invested."
277_4,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"We had enough dry powder to make 1 new investment, and
to participate in follow on rounds for our existing portfolio
companies (about 15 of them, if I remember correctly)."
277_5,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"Being post-MBA and dying to work in VC, I figured:

1) It's a VC job, damn it! I need to get my foot in the door in
the industry and if this firm wants to hire me I should go for
it.

 2) The firm doesn't have a lot of $ to do new deals, but given
the economy is great (keep in mind that I took the job in July
2008), they'll be able to raise another fund within the next
couple of years. So, Year 1 may be a little slow but after that
we'll have a new fund and plenty of capital to draw from to do
new deals.

 Then the public markets took a nose dive in late 2008.

 The prognosis for the VC industry was not good.

 Sequoia shared the infamous RIP Good Times deck (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vu30gv077iguw0ewnfl/kkhmh2u2z3l60fl/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zbGlkZXNoYXJlLm5ldC9lbGRvbi9zZXF1b2lhLWNhcGl0YWwtb24tc3RhcnR1cHMtYW5kLXRoZS1lY29ub21pYy1kb3dudHVybi1wcmVzZW50YXRpb24):

Which pretty much sums up what a mess things were back then.

(Keep in mind - this is SEQUOIA saying that things are not good.
 When one of the top (if not the top) firms in the world is
worried about the economic climate - then when you're working at
pretty much any other firm, you can consider yourself totally
hosed!)

 So, what did this mean for me and for my firm?

"
277_6,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"Well, a few things:

1) There was no way we would raising that new fund any time soon
- if ever. After the crash, the chance of us (or 75% of the other
active VC firms at the time) raising a fund was virtually nil.
 During that period almost no VC firms were writing checks to
companies, and no Limited Partners (investors in VC funds) were,
either.

 So, like all firms operating in that period, we hunkered down,
cut the burn rate of all of the companies where we had invested,
and figured out how to use the firm's capital reserves to make
sure our best companies had a shot at making it through the
recession.

"
277_7,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"2) The job became a lot LESS fun...and at times downright
depressing."
277_8,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"

 Everyone thinks VC is all about 'doing deals'.

"
277_9,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"But when times are tough, it's about making hard choices at the
board and partnership level.

 It's about portfolio company layoffs.

 It's about seeing your existing investments take a haircut:

Because you have to take new (and very 'expensive') money into
portfolio companies to keep them alive.

 You have no other choice.

"
277_10,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,I didn't have time to wait to see how things panned out.
277_11,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"

Being one year post-MBA there was a high opportunity cost for me
to stick it out at the firm and see if we could get some of our
companies through the recession.

 As much as I enjoyed my job and wanted to stay in VC...

...I knew the best thing for my family and I was to find a new
gig.

"
277_12,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"Fast.

 The next obvious question?

""Why didn't you go work at another VC firm?""

 Well:

Getting into VC is harder than getting a subsequent VC job, but
getting any VC job is still hard.

"
277_13,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"As I have written about in my blog and eBook (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/0vu30gv077iguw0ewnfl/e0hph0uw56rwki8/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL3Byb2R1Y3QvQjAwQ0YxVkM3Mi9yZWY9YXNfbGlfcWZfc3BfYXNpbl9pbF90bD9pZT1VVEY4JmNhbXA9MTc4OSZjcmVhdGl2ZT05MzI1JmNyZWF0aXZlQVNJTj1CMDBDRjFWQzcyJmxpbmtDb2RlPWFzMiZ0YWc9am9oZ2Fuc2Jsby0yMA=
), VC firms can afford to be extremely selective in who they hire
- and they can take their time because of that dynamic.

 When I decided I wanted to leave L Capital, I began interviewing
with a Boston firm that made their name by exiting an enterprise
IT company that sold for over $1 billion.

 After a round of interviews I had been asked to come up the
following week for dinner with the partnership - generally a
hiring sign if there ever was one.

 So, there was a good chance that if I kept with that firm's
hiring process, I could have stayed in the VC world.

 But around the same time, I received an offer from a startup - a
startup where I ultimately signed on as their first business
hire."
277_14,1663514758,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Why I left my VC job,"I knew that the startup experience would be invaluable if / when
I returned to the VC world, and that was what sealed the deal.

 That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!

I hope you're well and you're enjoying the summer!

 I wanted to get back to you about the founder's associate role that starts
in September - are you still looking for that position?

 I have talked with a good friend of mine, Sam
 (CV attached), and he
would be interested in the role. I've worked with him for the past two
years at START, where he was leading our hackathon and a team of seven.

 Would that be interesting for you?

Best regards and have a good start to your week,
Tim

 However, it is also equally important to recognize that web3 actually has created something remarkable: a decentralized global financial system powered by trust and empowered by technology.
 And over the course of 2022, this people-to-people network of trust has undergone the monster of all stress tests, this macro market correction—and passed.
"
283_4,1664216683,thecommonssector@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?q?Web3=E2=80=99s_Stress_Test?=,"Let’s dive in.
 Money is ultimately an exercise in trust at scale. For a piece of paper, a coin or any other object to represent value, there needs to be mutual trust between strangers that the paper, coin or what have you will truly convert into however much value it represents. Mutual trust at scale in the convertibility of money undergirds the cooperation needed for multi-sided marketplaces to operate efficiently and effectively. Such money unlocks human capital from the fair payment for services rendered, to the exchange of goods between people that helps improve the quality of life, to investment in new ideas and innovations with an expectation of future return, to the establishment of trading relationships amongst nations to support peaceful co-existence. 
 Without universally accepted currencies as a base layer, society would not have evolved past feudalism.   Money is why Adam Smith’s butcher, brewer and baker [ https://substack.com/redirect/7ad4347e-386d-4803-9716-b14d6001d842?r=o1saq ] can all pursue their ambitions, including reinvesting in their enterprises to increase the efficiencies of their production and accelerate growth to the benefit of the collective good. The human progress achieved through capitalism’s ability to grow the economic pie by lending capital has depended on money. 
 But for all of human history up until recently, for the convertibility of money to be trusted and accepted at the necessary universal scale, it had to be issued and backed by a centralized, recognizable entity—typically a sovereign entity or an established, centralized financial institution (I am old enough to remember American Express Traveler’s Checks!).
 With blockchain, however, it is the technology (not a central authority)—and in particular the immutability and decentralized, public-ledger nature of the technology—that provides the necessary trust for digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana to be universally accepted.
 Moreover, the technology actually is an improvement upon fiat currency because a cryptocurrency’s digital architecture means it can be transmitted more efficiently, making it more open and thus more accessible and universal. You don’t need a bank to process a transaction—just access to the Internet. You don’t need to convert between fiat currencies—digital assets can be accessed wherever you are. The money doesn’t require physical handling because it can all be stored electronically. It is also programmable, meaning you can directly build on the digital money, which (amongst many advantages) allows for people to own their work."
283_5,1664216683,thecommonssector@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?q?Web3=E2=80=99s_Stress_Test?=,"Consider how fast mobile payment caught on in emerging markets where so many were unbanked but had phones. Since digital currencies are mutually trusted, universally accepted, and superior for both the ability to transmit money and more fully participate in the distribution of money—digital assets are in fact a better base layer for society when it comes to how money can unlock human capital. This “better money” is why digital assets are the foundation upon which the coming web3 economy will be built. And a reason why web3 is inevitable, offering policymakers an unmissable opportunity to reset how they govern technology when it comes to disrupting for humans and not at the expense of humans.  
 So to those who ask what web3 has created—the creation of trust through the blockchain technology that made these global digital assets possible is in and of itself a massive accomplishment and should be recognized as such. To put this achievement into perspective, consider that not until the National Banking Acts of the 1860s did the dollar even become the sole fiat currency of the United States. Europe needed more than a decade to truly launch the Euro. In comparison, Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 and released in 2009, and Etheruem transformed from an idea to a global currency in two years.
 While 2022 has been filled with breathless pointing to the latest crypto winter, including the failures of Celsius and Terra (arguably, not even true defi protocols and ones where needed regulations around collateralization, liquidity and reporting would have prevented), as proof that there is “no there, there,” this conclusion misses the bigger point.  
"
283_6,1664216683,thecommonssector@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?q?Web3=E2=80=99s_Stress_Test?=,"Much like Copernicus stepping back so as to see, in looking up at the sky, that it was not the sun moving around Earth but the Earth moving around the sun, it’s important to step back and recognize that the true lesson of this market correction is not the small number of (admittedly splashy) failures, but the much more significant fact that web3 passed a monster market stress test.
 In the face of a hugely significant, global macro market correction, digital currencies have not dropped to zero (as some predicted). Objectively, the overwhelming majority of defi protocols have successfully weathered the downturn, demonstrating the resiliency of their models. And exciting new web3 projects continue to launch. 
 And the reason web3 passed this market stress test is because its underlying technology builds mutual trust. Three numbers underscore this:
320 million: Over 320 million people reportedly own a digital currency, about the same number as the total US population—and a number that has held steady over the course of 2022. Even in the face of significant market volatility, this stability has proven that the technology inspires the mutual trust needed to maintain a strong conviction in the value and convertibility of these digital currencies. 
 35: As many surveys have documented, those under the age of 35 who own digital currencies vastly over-index all other age groups—they are the base users. By 2025, people currently under the age of 35 will represent around half of all consumers. I have shared in prior posts that these young adults are attracted to digital assets because they understand that the technology offers them greater access to the financial system, including the ability to own their work and the returns from their work. Going forward, the choices made by people under age 35 in terms of which products they choose and which services they use will drive the global economy. Their belief in the ability of web3 technology to foster a more open, accessible and inclusive economic system is a big reason why web3 will be the internet for the next billion people. 
 400,000 (per beaconcha.in): Last week, Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake involved the participation of over 400,000 validators (participant in a blockchain who verifies a transaction), impacting 71 million wallets, 1 million daily transactions, and 120 million coins in changing some of the underlying technology so as to reduce its energy consumption. The result reportedly was the single largest human-led decarbonization event in history. It was organized and led by the Ethereum community without any legal obligations or requirements by a sovereign government, proving that such decentralized systems are more than capable of cooperation at a mass scale.
 Web3 has been described as the “internet of value,” and beneath that value lies an increasingly solidifying trust created by the people, for the people and of the people through the enabling technology of the blockchain. And at a moment when trust in institutions is declining all across the board, the successful creation of global currencies backed not by a government or a financial institution but by the participation of hundreds of million people is a movement built on trust.  
"
283_7,1664216683,thecommonssector@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?q?Web3=E2=80=99s_Stress_Test?=,"Web3-deniers, that is a big deal. 
 And an even bigger deal is that over the course of this significant macro correction, this trust in the world’s first decentralized, universally accepted global digital currencies has gone through a massive market stress test and passed. 
 The story of 2022 is not the failure of web3—it is the success of web3 in building not just widespread proof of trust, but a model for it.

 Liebe OMR-Leser*innen,

der Tod eines Menschen ist immer ein trauriger Anlass zusammenzukommen.
 Bei der Beerdigung der Queen nimmt das Ganze aber andere Dimensionen an.
 Die Trauerfeierlichkeiten sollen sich laut Daily Mail heute rund 4,1
Milliarden Menschen angucken - damit würde das Event zu dem mit der
höchsten TV-Quote der Weltgeschichte. Gut, dass Tschernobyl kein
Fernsehhit wurde, wundert nicht, wo es 1986 doch weder Smartphones noch
so viele Fernseher wie heute gab. 

 Trotzdem viel Spaß beim Glotzen

Florian

Christian Seifert hat aus der Fußball-Bundesliga ein Milliarden-Produkt
gemacht. Andere Sportarten konnten mit dieser Entwicklung in Deutschland
nicht mithalten. Handball, Basketball oder Tischtennis finden
öffentlich kaum statt. Mit einem eigenen Sport-Streamingdienst will
Christian Seifert das jetzt ändern - und setzt dabei auch auf die

 Wie realistisch sind Netflix' Werbepreise?

 Netflix scheint den Start seines werbebasierten Abo-Modells vorverlegt
zu haben: Statt im August 2023 soll das Angebot doch schon am 1.
 November dieses Jahres launchen, berichtet das Wallstreet Journal.
 Deshalb haben sich auch bereits Vertreter des Streamingdienstes mit
potenziellen Anzeigenkunden getroffen. Und auch gleich die Dimensionen
der künftigen Deals festgelegt: Netflix will seinen Werbekunden pro
Tausend Zuschauenden 65 US-Dollar in Rechnung stellen - weit mehr als
andere großen Medienunternehmen. 

 Zum Vergleich: Im US-Fernsehen beläuft sich der Tausend-Kontakt-Preis
auf eine Summe zwischen 16 und 24, zur Primetime bis zu 45 US-Dollar.
 Und
Streamingkonkurrent Hulu, der zum Disneykonzern gehört, kommt auf Werte
zwischen 20 und 30 US-Dollar.
 Pokert
Netflix also zu hoch?

Jerry Capital:
Setzt
Netflix hoch an, könnte sich ein Fahrstuhleffekt einstellen und die
gesamte Branche langfristig davon profitieren. Setzt das Unternehmen zu
niedrig an, braucht es schnell viele Werbetreibende, denn Netflix wird
durch das günstigere Abo-Modell auch Einnahmen verlieren, nämlich
dann, wenn Subscriber*innen vom teureren, werbefreien Abo auf die
günstigere Variante wechseln."

US-Dollar pro Tausend Kontakten in Rechnung stellen zu können. Die
Begründung: Dank des ausgefuchsten Content-Algorithmus hilft Netflix
den Werbetreibenden bestimmte Zielgruppen anzusprechen. Maximal vier
Minuten pro Programmstunde stellt das Unternehmen dafür zur Verfügung,
die Clips sollen zwischen 15 und 30 Sekunden lang sein.

As the fields of psychedelic neuroscience and pharmacology break through decades of cultural stigma, pharmaceutical companies seem eager to push psychedelic formulations into clinical trials.

 Investors exploring the opportunities in this innovative space could be confused by the debate around psychedelics’ true potential. A recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), for example, highlighted that Psilocybin - the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms” has the potential to curtail alcohol abuse (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VJ33pds1V1-WJV7CgMNGW2vVDgy1rNH_HN7M-nLSbH0LkW4d7QXx56M0szW3fsd6X6rk1gYW7L3zpc7VgkNkW7cjYT21yxwLkMl5211t0WV6N8Ljz6tFtvz5Vv2N9V7jdw6qVvGZ2T8Q4f_JW2T6HGT14NjgrW7LgX3G2Rq-fCW440gCS5Z-1ckW8sRWMB7_5cC1W3pJLM97nbdJpW8QThqq5QVxDsW6PPKzs4FL202W90BV4F8jqyKkN4yf0Wt3T929W2pkf6G48PpCYN51b5zbSHJ4SW13qXdG5Kqj4gW5nf8_h4wnf6YW8hmdb51pyV_yW5H6hpL1bBmX1W7PQ0PX2XMkWdW22Sycq97LkN8W23G41X7jwz3j2fr1 ) . On the heels of that article, JAMA Psychiatry featured a comment by Roland Griffiths, a prominent researcher in psychedelic neuroscience, warning that the hype surrounding psychedelics could exaggerate their utility (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VJ33pds1V1-WJV7CgHp1W56BrSC2FB3qtW8tv7JQ2zJ2sWN6w893zYjmskW8dGTr48n4KVZW9k0B656DtlDfW8FQ9VY8y-BlFW6GHMRd88HWgFW8y6VfF884K_6N2LFfrKW5tHhW3Tp-jj6ln2KGVyYWBT8QL_2fW90dSH22Ph_0zW7F14Wy3VwMhWW2lq32F6F5pdQW6wdnl77-LFJLW1BfGYW3kTXH2W4qZ5v064fbm2W81txdL6HshyvW9cQLLh2XGZ9cW5_nkRB93hMJcW30trQJ25xVk8W3tJmS_49xrFcN2LRrF0TXT3FN1NxLdY2ywg-W4LJ-Mb1b8ZBwW2sdSN32gPBx4Vt340_99pJ1fW40r4g15vkPgL3dny1 ) .

Indeed, its image-generation model seems superior to DALL·E 2 in certain domains, particularly face generation.

 Among the important differences between the two models, Stable Diffusion is open source and places few constraints on generation requests."

In contrast, OpenAI curbs the generation of offensive and other controversial images.

 The proliferation of open-source DALL·E 2-like models raises an important question for investors: will these models be commoditized? We believe large models trained on publicly available data will be commoditized, while models trained on proprietary data will remain differentiated and difficult to duplicate."

On August 24, Coinbase launched a liquid staking product (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VHN3pdrLV1-WJV7CgJY1W3DkpjP7c_2k1W7_RTYx8HdjTmW7CCr1s3YJ7GWW5nf0c05FZHFMW4pCHXc4xTPvcW44K3G7782-HxW7mwQR03tBgHNN1CjjW7SVx5QW77q9Sy7jF12BW30M8Zp2D2DDhW4W-f9x3dsbCqW7YlPX55z3ZjzW23mdTV8r5t0TW6t-WXz7Wp4-4W2Z26gV8RrdW9W4FKYKT8bsksgVW0Chp7m_YmyW9kplvv1tFlwTW3535Dv6p6S5YN7P9GxdLvh_SW28HD-X7vFn54W7-gpG-2qJKT4Vqrhhm4L09hcW91Lw335BM96gW5JCH6423s0F0W1MDF_b8Q8npY3hPs1 ) , cbETH. Like Lido’s liquid staked ether, stETH (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VHt5mNYDV3Zsc37CgXsKW3CmsV88LC0VpN7rhCcPClMScVPy01k46bCzRW6rTGqB18KBn6W39y0Fm1V5Gr4W2N-0HP1fYwkYN2_JQf_H5yNLW5Z_N404cwy4TW75Kc7755ytkCW4ZljGc3YZtXqW3yc4Nn9lc9DvW12S-1X1ZpRB7VXtPqx2ppf_sV1F2pL5DRhQ3Vf0nDQ1k7MTgW2gfW5r183P3dV8WpF11XqcsmN6JzT0923yJfW4V6FQm6_QZ8HW4KHmJK22f5lxVwm4gG5d25XHW6KJBJ76KnbC3W1XtQ6H6wrCFrW6yHBBf61svn9W1QR1N95y2s2lMXpZWlC6X9nW44zTBk3VCZqnN5PtWdPK69YlN36qg_yz4WD_W5ddjDl7jRXgBW8rLxxd5npbK8W4XvrYl5z2FBtW6jtcWV92tHpHW50qpd35f7y67W8hX68f2FQlm8W6kxF4y4-ZxVwW3Wy4Rw47cXm2W7rH_3551b6XzW69ZsD_2Wgfv8W4fn3gL1XMB9g3byc1 ) , cbETH creates a tokenized deposit that offers redemption rights to the ether staked on its platform. As the name suggests, liquid staking will offer more liquidity to assets staked in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network by allowing users to transfer, trade, or use the token in decentralized finance (DeFi) without disturbing the underlying assets.

 As the first major exchange to offer a liquid staking product, Coinbase is attempting to gain share in a market characterized by highly profitable, less volatile, recurring revenue that could be an important diversifier to its base trading business."

In other words, cbETH’s outstanding supply is worth ~$1 billion today.

 Coinbase’s liquid staking product makes several distinctive design decisions compared to Lido. While Lido’s stETH is based on the “aToken (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VHt3pdrrV1-WJV7CgQxlW4fbNR32trbGMW4qbSj17W1TF7W5Tkxs01V39G_W5dt3Yy1r9HQfVNM26H4LwHsfV54Tpb6yGSj-W8wkZzp3ScSVpW5fhjL-89vkbjW5r8VN94zKR6mW1lHCQ55t0Cq1W9l7tz_2yQgy2W4PJHJr30PLZnW90TNZj4zmH2-W7wyJSs4krq1lW4qC5JK7Gt7shW3XrZnr7d_byhW4TYQlW27Mr8ZW86QP-W5-lSWZW52BMhz5_sjzvW4g72zM7pXzdnW37_r2k8-m6pbW4hZWrh8Y6ttvW47-_Fq1HvmmnVd99lw64r-0C3j0Z1 ) ” model, which updates holder balances daily to reflect interest accrued, cbETH uses the “cToken (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VJ33pds1V1-WJV7CgHn6W8BPCGs7lFVMsW1SgR3w7Xjm1cW2sMWB43NqltBW4vYQSV5x1mPXN8dZ_Hq1x-_NW8Xy8MS3fmy9BW3Jk_q38QJK5CW5MyjH04QSD-0W6zDvgp8Ddc-wW4ZhvkV8mrnDTW1_Nq8f858ty7W2N2F3b3s0CFTW1CtsB36L8YdPN7JPHw35Wt8zW3j7G9h3yZB-pW5j-W1Y3GnmFWW7Ld1hW9hjyNNW8dZqG74n20t3W8jgxSY2LnRMnW6cx9Xk3Xw_6LW5fF_QK6hXv0LW1H1n--3yZnDrW1Qt5QV8PgX-KW4PfhZL1gSBS2W77R_3b7G2LRHV2Ln5W4XzFf5W5C1NFv61kWwZVXYQV38jG50G36dw1 ) ” model, which reports holder balances based on the original deposit while the redemption value of their tokens increases over time."
289_13,1662468464,ark@arkinvest.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,"ARK Publishes A New Study On The Therapeutic Potential Of --  Psychedelics, And More...","In practice, it appears that the latter model is less intuitive for users, as 1 cbETH does not equal 1 ETH over time. That said, the cToken model does reduce the complexity associated with integrating tokens into downstream DeFI, which could accelerate the adoption of cbETH.

 The two models also may differ in their tax treatment. While we are not offering any advice or opinion on the matter, some crypto tax professionals suggest (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VJ33pds1V1-WJV7CgYfsW7MQGcW41pVg-W2MVWnB89_ZmwW5bw4RN6V1pDwW5CXb373HTycNN2pfNWS1lpJyW3wXnth4hqK2JW6dzcZg94z60fW7SgWRK4mj6D-W2wF7R03yBzXPN7Cd-dRHn4NzW3Mz0Xb46m2s5VXD1CZ5vXLGYW2kSv2w8kM_NNW17fgGY2l4GWhW8Qw04Z85npCQW4rwBy92JlsHMW3F145b4gjFymN8F2pckwm6tpW83XPzb46Ngn3W29plVJ15c1NqW2f4Mj689Jb1dVfD4c31P2B95W4Xl4sn54PbD7N6mZmj8_CvDZVlNJWf493LnMW4JyG6z43x6gfW1FXpGQ4y6zDlW4HNK2s7HMqlS3cSS1 ) that cToken appreciation could be treated as capital gains, while aToken interest is ordinary income. Coinbase takes a 25% cut on cbETH staking income, while Lido charges just 10% (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VJ33pds1V1-WJV7CgHn6W8BPCGs7lFVMsW1SgR3w7Xjm1cW2sMWB43NqltBW4vYQSV5x1mPXN8dZ_Hq1x-_NW8Xy8MS3fmy9BW3Jk_q38QJK5CW5MyjH04QSD-0W6zDvgp8Ddc-wW4ZhvkV8mrnDTW1_Nq8f858ty7W2N2F3b3s0CFTW1CtsB36L8YdPN7JPHw35Wt8zW3j7G9h3yZB-pW5j-W1Y3GnmFWW7Ld1hW9hjyNNW8dZqG74n20t3W8jgxSY2LnRMnW6cx9Xk3Xw_6LW5fF_QK6hXv0LW1H1n--3yZnDrW1Qt5QV8PgX-KW4PfhZL1gSBS2W77R_3b7G2LRHV2Ln5W4XzFf5W5C1NFv61kWwZVXYQV38jG50G36dw1 ) on stETH staking income.

 Perhaps the most important and controversial difference between the two services is that Lido distributes its validator pool across a global network of 29 node operators (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VHt3pdrrV1-WJV7CgJLHW7970Cv8t9s6cW8f-2SJ4jxFPSW4BPHqb21F71JW2qcPzy2LcH9RVht0l876hft1W36gnSn7S1x7CW7m-tGd4LGrrdW6Q6m3q1f3ZshN1SHkpq5YYd_W7v-s4C37MpztN8Nw4Ypsgh4pW60dbWy4cMC3XW6fdWK52qlDC4W64Sh19669y3_W3PRdpL2hdZbXVdb_sX183ctJW5wDBbg1CtL0cW2rPgrQ63qtWfW3FlTfg7SPf20W6gPBWD3lNXVqW2LLP9821V_W-W616-0j66_YgHW4Ffccd3hfD1vW5KRPJZ7swVTT3ccp1 ) and plans to decentralize its operations even more over time. In contrast, Coinbase will be the sole issuer and controller of cbETH.

 This difference creates an interesting decision point for end users. Will they choose the stability and convenience that Coinbase offers, or the decentralized and censorship-resistant approach that Lido has created?

Importantly, because Coinbase will be able to freeze cbETH assets when required by law, will its proliferation increase crypto centralization and the risk of censorship? After OFAC’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWqS4f5MXVg5VbTX7c46K4KHW4sKGqD4PDpTJN3X6VHN3pdrLV1-WJV7CgCWhW2fD01M73x_48W7Fgl9_5K2VHVW9kdLjm3SzJG-W6Rnx7n3nGN_PW71RPb21zyS1ZW7vt6KK99DVRmW3fCSYS210wKpVbgS0n8wVc-TN6Q1y5v9j6JHW8GBbD53_FvGGW8fjTdv57RgBYW4BvkqT3Z4xDVW8wX4vp4Qks3BW3mTqNb86T7LPW6BgdXQ9hln3FN61FlxQV1M1_W3NCpdR5sTmP7W1V4wZQ2LmkK3W3gvs233MVPfHVpD73942f6tzW3bnp-25_wXNHW68w_LY8gP0DhW3hJlNL2zGjCqN1V7YS6hz8xFW2-N3jy8DWqGtVlDmJk5x3Jpd31q91 ) in August, this hot topic is getting hotter by the minute.

 Fact of the week

Coinbase launched a liquid staking product, cbETH.

Not Boring Capital is an $8 million venture fund that invests in companies with stories to tell, and helps tell them. Ultimately, there is no Not Boring Capital without all of you, so I want this to be a little bit different than a normal fund announcement.

 Instead, I’ll take you behind the scenes of the fundraising process, talk about some of the investments Not Boring Capital has made thus far, and share the LP Update I sent yesterday. I’m still learning how all of this works, and as always, I figured it would be more fun if we learned together."

A COIN CRUSADECOINBASE AND CRYPTO ENTHUSIASTS TAKE ON THE TREASURY
This week, we learned that Coinbase is footing the bill for a lawsuit filed against the Treasury Department by users of the recently sanctioned crypto service, Tornado Cash. 
 The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August. 
 Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable."
296_1,1662671237,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,A chilling effect on innovation?,"The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors. 
 But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family’s security. 
 “Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,” according to the lawsuit. 
 The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry. 
 “We saw this as a much larger problem,” Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. “It sets a dangerous precedent — if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.” 
Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, “we wouldn’t ban all use of that highway.” Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs’ lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court. 
 The suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury’s authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses “a hammer instead of a scalpel.” The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list. 
 Coinbase is not only a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, but also the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking.
 "
296_2,1662671237,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,A chilling effect on innovation?,"“We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,” Grewal said. “We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone’s good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies.”"

 ONE MORE THING...
 TIKTOK IS UPENDING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND SPOTIFY MAY BE NEXTZoi Lerma was working at a Los Angeles bagel shop in early 2020 when she first heard the song “Supalonely” by Benee. "
296_5,1662671237,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,A chilling effect on innovation?,"She liked it so much that she choreographed a dance to the tune and posted it on TikTok. Her video has since amassed more than 45 million views, turning her into a TikTok celebrity and helping to make Benee a global sensation. 
 As of Sept. 2, “Supalonely” has appeared in more than 5.7 million videos from thousands of TikTok users.  Benee performed two sold-out arena shows in New Zealand in October 2020, and she was nominated for new artist of 2020 at the People’s Choice Awards. Her hit song has gone platinum, meaning it’s sold the equivalent of 1 million copies, in eight countries, and has more than 2.1 billion streams across all platforms.  “When it started trending on TikTok and picking up on TikTok, I would hear it on the radio or, you know, hear it in stores,” Lerma, who’s now 20, said in an interview with CNBC."

296_7,1662671237,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,A chilling effect on innovation?,"Far from her days in a hot Southern California kitchen, Lerma now has 6 million followers on TikTok and makes a living by promoting music on the app and using her influence to partner with brands.  She’s also part of the TikTok Creator Fund, which pays popular contributors when their videos take off. 
 TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, is turning the music business on its head by increasingly becoming a hit-making machine. Artists can go from obscurity to global superstardom, thanks to a viral video that could be posted by a complete stranger. Even Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” reentered the charts in 2020 after a clip of a man drinking cranberry juice on a skateboard exploded on the app. "

chapter has partnered up with the biggest entrepreneurial institutions and
already has over 300 sign-ups for their event.
 However, they have altered the sign-up process and used their own sign-up
system via Eventbrite to simplify it for online and on-site participants.

 We agree that this is not what was initially planned, so we suggest they
still register through the official YC registration form and then host the
ZOOM call offline. In addition, we'll also send you the numbers of offline
participants after the event. Would this work for you?

 However, it would be super helpful for us to clarify the date for the two
events ahead of the 14th.
 We checked with all other universities and thought one event in *week 8*
(e.g., 02/26) and one in* week 9* (e.g., 03/05) would work best with the
exam schedule of the different universities.
 Would this also work for your timeline?

I talked to our network and a few friends and confirmed *12 locations with
18 different universities*. I think we can push this to 25 universities
until the beginning of the Outreach tour.

 However, they raised a few questions:

   - What is the rough timeline for the Outreach tour? Unfortunately, we
   have an exam phase in January. Therefore doing this event at the beginning
   of February would make the most sense in my opinion, does this work for
   you?
   - My original idea was to organize watch parties at each university
   where interested students could watch the interview and connect."
324_1,1639620396,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,tamanna@ycombinator.com,,Re: intro: Tamanna Khemani (YC). <> Tim Birkhofer (START Conference),"Do you
   typically do this as well, or can people join the zoom from home as well?
   - Would you prefer one event streamed to all locations or bundle
   locations regarding their country/ecosystem?

Would you have time in the coming week to quickly discuss these questions?

Best regards,
Tim

Congrats to an amazing S21 batch, a few friends of mine got in, and they
absolutely loved it.

 I just saw your post for the fall outreach tour and wanted to get back in
touch a bit earlier than last year to see how we can work together for the
YC Outreach tour and our START Summit in March.

 With Station F and Lanzandera, you only have two European stops for the
fall tour. Therefore we could both benefit from you leveraging our START
Network of 12 chapters across European entrepreneurial hotspots (Berlin,
Munich, Lisbon, ...).

 Would you have time for a call next week to discuss how we can attract
those talents who make something people want ?

Best regards and enjoy your weekend,
Tim

The main question is, how Michael would like to be introduced by our stage
host Jack Vincent?
Is there a specific title you want to have displayed? A broader topic would
fit best, as we have prepped 3 topics for the interview from which Michael
can choose. I also add the pdf with the topics and questions to the google
invite.

I hope you are well.

 I wanted to let you know that we posted our speaker announcement
of
Michael.
 Additionally, I wanted to add that we highly appreciate that you organized
this on such short notice.
 Down below I attached our design for Micheal's post if you would like to
share. This would greatly help us promote the event and give a final boost
two weeks before the event.

 Regarding the actual talk, I will add all information asap (zoom link,
login to the platform, interviewer, topic).

 Best regards and have a nice weekend,

the most important magazine for startup-related content in the DACH region.
 This would mean that in the first 20 minutes he interview Michael instead
of a Keynote and in the second half it would switch to a Q&A.

Otherwise, we can obviously do the same format that Michael did at Seedery
(Keynote + Q&A), which we discussed yesterday.
 Is that something you would be interested in?

I hope you are well.

 I am getting back to you regarding Jeannette's & Thomas' Fireside Chat at
START Summit. As I have been out quite sick throughout the last few days
with no real improvement in sight, Jeannine (in CC) will have to take over
the coordination of the format and be your contact person from here on out.

 Jeannette & Thomas, you should have received calendar invites for hotels
and transfers as regards any logistics. If any further questions arise, you
can always reach out to Jeannine.

 I hope you can understand – I'm sure the Fireside Chat will be amazing!

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

kennt Ihr die Netflix-Doku ""Don't Fuck with Cats? Darin geht es um eine
hysterische Community aus Hobby-Detektiven, die einen Tierquäler quer
durch's Internet jagt, bis sie ihn in Montreal ausfindig machen, wo er
bereits zum Mörder wurde. 

Ich musste oft an diesen Film denken, während meiner Recherche zum
unten stehenden OMR Daily Text. Immer wieder fragte ich mich: Weshalb
setzen sich die Protagonisten meiner Geschichte scheinbar freiwillig
einer Horde von Hobbydetektiven aus? Welchen Reiz hat es für sie, im
Zentrum unsäglicher Verschwörungstheorien zu stehen? Geht es dabei
wirklich nur um Geld und Fame - oder steckt eine andere Motivation
dahinter? 

"
383_1,1662464625,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Help me,"Ich habe keine konkreten Antworten auf diese Fragen bekommen. Aber ich
habe einen Einblick in die dunkelsten Ecken des Internets erhalten und
hoffe, Ihr findet den Text genauso interessant und alarmierend wie ich.

Don't click that link.

Ob Podcast, Youtube-Serie oder Print-Magazin: Millionen von Menschen
lassen sich regelmäßig von True-Crime-Content begeistern. Doch der
Hype um die düsteren Machenschaften hat auch seine Schattenseiten. Es
geht um Influencer, die im Verdacht stehen, für Views ihre eigene
Entführung oder Missbrauch vorzutäuschen. Um Internet-Detektive, die
Verschwörungstheorien streuen und dann abkassieren. Und um
Social-Media-Plattformen, die tatenlos dabei zusehen, wie ihr
Algorithmus Fakes und Gerüchte immer mehr verbreitet. OMR gibt einen
Einblick in das Ökosystem der Fake Crime Creator.

⚽️ Datenleck: Instagram muss 400 Millionen Euro Strafe
zahlen

Es ist die dritte und bislang höchste Strafe für ein Unternehmen des
Meta-Konzerns: Die irische Datenschutzbehörde hat Instagram eine
Zahlung von 405"
383_2,1662464625,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Help me,"Millionen Euro auferlegt.

 Wie die Behörde in einer zweijährigen Untersuchung feststellte, sei
das Unternehmen bis vor kurzem zu fahrlässig mit der Privatsphäre von
Kindern umgegangen. Es habe unter anderem deren E-Mail-Adressen und
Telefonnummern widerrechtlich veröffentlicht. 

 Darin besteht das Problem: Im Kern geht es darum, dass Instagram Kindern
zwischen 13 und 17 Jahren bis vor einem Jahr erlaubt hat, Business
Accounts zu eröffnen. Manche taten das, weil diese genauere Insights
und Statistiken zum eigenen Profil bieten. Das hatte allerdings zur
Folge, dass die Nutzerkontaktdaten - wie bei Business Accounts üblich
- öffentlich einsehbar waren. Auch andere Daten von jungen Nutzenden
habe Instagram standardmäßig öffentlich gemacht.

 Beides sieht die irische Behörde als Vergehen gegen die DSGVO an. 

 Das große Ganze: Für den Meta-Konzern ist es bereits die dritte Strafe
innerhalb eines Jahres. Im September 2021 ordnete die Behörde
gegenüber Whatsapp eine Zahlung von 225 Millionen Euro an
,
weil das Unternehmen versäumt hatte, die Nutzenden ausreichend über
die Verwendung ihrer Daten zu informieren. Wegen ähnlicher Vergehen
folgte im März dieses Jahres eine 17-Millionen-Euro-Strafe gegen
Facebook
.

 Die 400-Millionen-Strafe für Instagram stellt die zweithöchste je
gegen ein Unternehmen ausgesprochene Strafe einer EU-Datenschutzbehörde
dar. Nur Amazon musste mit 746 Millionen Euro mehr bezahlen
.
 Allerdings hat Instagram noch einiges mehr zu befürchten: Denn die
irische Datenschutzbehörde führt derzeit noch mindestens sechs weitere
Untersuchungen gegen das Unternehmen."
383_3,1662464625,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Help me,"Das sagen die Täter dazu: Gegenüber der US-Zeitung Politico sagte ein
Meta-Sprecher, es handle sich bei den Vorwürfen um alte Einstellungen,
die längst nicht mehr verwendet werden. Mittlerweile würden alle
Accounts von Nutzenden unter 18 Jahren automatisch im privaten Modus
sein, von anderen Nutzenden kontaktiert werden könnten sie ebenfalls
nicht. ""Wir werden die endgültige Entscheidung sorgfältig prüfen"",
ließ er sich zitieren.

  Newsbites: Tiktok, Tiktoks Mum, Axel Springer

Hickhack: Wir haben Tiktok gehackt, sagt die Hackergruppe
""AgainstTheWest"". Stimmt nicht, sagt Tiktok und weiter, es handle sich
dabei um öffentliche Informationen. Im Zentrum der Debatte: 800
Gigabyte Nutzerdaten, Plattformstatistiken, Programmiercode.

 Rolle rückwärts: Tiktokts Mutterfirma ByteDance mit Sitz in Peking hat
hunderte Mitarbeitende der Gaming Unit gekündigt oder versetzt. Zum
einen sei das in der strengen Zensur der chinesischen Regierung
begründet, die jedes Spiel i m Detail prüft, selbst die Storyplots und
Kleidung der Spielfiguren, wie die South China Morning Post berichtet.

 Außerdem soll der neue ByteDance-Chef Liang Rubo erste Geschäftsfelder
mit schwacher Rentabilität ausdünnen. ""Muskeln wachsen lassen und Fett
reduzieren"" nennt er diese Strategie."
383_4,1662464625,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Help me,"Es reichelt wieder: Eine Ex-Geliebte von Julian Reichelt hat eine
Schadensersatzklage gegen Springer eingereicht. Der Vorwurf: Reichelt
soll seine Position als Chefredakteur im Kontext der Beziehung zur
Mitarbeiterin ausgenutzt haben. Der Fall geht ausgerechnet in den USA
vor Gericht, wo die Mitarbeiterin in Kalifornien für die ""Bild-Zeitung""
tätig war - und eine hohe Sensibilität für Metoo-Themen herrscht.

This would increase the utilization of its existing delivery fleet.

But Pendo isn’t an outlier. Lately we’ve seen loads of software companies—and PLG companies in particular—either buy or build their own media and community properties:

 Paddle acquired ProfitWell, a software company and powerhouse media entity.
 Semrush acquired Backlinko, a newsletter reaching 170,000+ marketers.
 Mailchimp acquired Courier, a British bimonthly magazine teaching business smarts.
 Shopify launched Shopify Studios, a TV and film production company meant to inspire entrepreneurship (they produced “Own the Room [ https://substack.com/redirect/ebd60902-f0ea-4466-aef4-714a2c248f19?r=o1saq ]” on Disney+).
 HubSpot Co-Founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah summed up the sentiment well. “Next-gen software companies will have a media company embedded inside,” he tweeted in October 2020.

 These types of communities reach new audiences who are highly qualified because they've interacted with current users. They create stickiness by increasing the switching costs associated with changing vendors. And they make users more successful with adopting your product for more and more use cases. 
 Six insights for acquiring a media and community asset
Insight #1: These acquisitions are low-risk bets on an uncertain future
If you consider the size of the acquirer relative to the cost of the target, one thing becomes clear: these are relatively low-risk bets. HubSpot reportedly spent $27M on buying The Hustle—a fraction of the company’s current $13B market cap (0.2% to be exact)."
386_16,1664967711,kylepoyar@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,=?utf-8?b?U2hvdWxkIHlvdSBidXkgYSBtZWRpYSBjb21wYW55PyDwn46Z77iP?=,"These bets get even less risky if you pay mostly with stock rather than cash.
 Big SaaS companies with billion dollar valuations can afford to treat media acquisitions as experiments and as an insurance policy against uncertain future outcomes. They don’t necessarily need to build a comprehensive business case with board-approved targets in order to get the green light on an acquisition. These types of acquisitions haven’t been proven out yet among earlier stage (Seed-Series C) or more cash-constrained companies. 
 With that in mind, the acquisition thesis tends to be centered around go-to-market efficiency and bringing strategic hires into the company. 
 Do you buy into SEO getting more challenging and harder to rely on?

Insight #3: Get comfortable with imperfect attribution

 Our suspicion: if SaaS companies could solve this attribution problem, we’d be seeing folks pay a lot more for media assets.
 Just because you won’t have perfect attribution doesn’t mean you shouldn’t attempt to measure the impact of the acquisition. This should start during the diligence phase as you evaluate assets. Here’s how to de-risk an acquisition:
Test before buying: this usually starts with being a sponsor or partner
Check the audience overlap to determine the fit with your target audience as well as the incremental reach to be gained
Measure the value of that audience relative to alternative ways of reaching it
Validate the P&L to understand the operating costs and potential ongoing expenses to maintain or grow the property
Insight #4: Do what it takes to keep key employees
Media properties tend to live or die on the basis of one or two key employees. These strategic “acqui-hires” are critical to continuing to innovate on the media strategy. They’re extremely influential and trusted within your target audience. And they bring new skills, DNA, and expertise to your company. 
 Here’s how you keep them.

The navigation bar of The Hustle links out to HubSpot’s blog and prominently displays HubSpot’s logo. 
 Pendo partnered with Mind the Product on a joint product-led certification course, which got promoted to both audiences. This course builds on what Mind the Product is known for while creating a bridge for Mind the Product’s audience to discover Pendo.
Courier, traditionally a print magazine, can be found digitally on Mailchimp’s parent domain (https://mailchimp.com/courier/ [ https://substack.com/redirect/88cc5af7-a853-4a06-84f7-dca1aaca2fae?r=o1saq ]). This helps attract a large audience for Courier while putting Mailchimp’s brand front-and-center as the presenting sponsor.
 Insight #6: Grow the media asset, don’t just maintain it

These acquisitions are low-risk bets on an uncertain future.
 Buying is normally better than building.
Get comfortable with imperfect attribution.
 Do what it takes to keep key employees.

 Grow the media asset, don’t just maintain it.

 If you're not familiar with Pinterest, the product launched in March 2010 as a way to ""pin"" collections of images together."

  Over time, it has kept that DNA, and its mobile app has evolved to be slightly more of a feed-based image and video browsing experience like Instagram and TikTok."
391_6,1662472107,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Shuffles: Pinterest's Plan to Reach Gen Z,"Shuffles feels like it ties back to Pinterest's original use case.

Along the way, it raised money from Benchmark, monetized with advertising and affiliate links, reached profitability ( https://thehustle.co/jess-lee-polyvore/ ), and was acquired ( https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/31/yahoo-acquires-polyvore/ ) by Yahoo for $200 million in 2015.
 Here's an old screenshot of a Polyvore profile:

Polyvore's tech was arguably more powerful than Pinterest, allowing users to bookmark or ""clip"" an item from any image from around the web and add it to their Polyvore image library to later be combined with other clips to make a set. In addition, affiliate links would automatically update if a partner made any change on their end.

Most importantly, widespread adoption of tools like Shopify and BigCommerce have digitized the long-tail of ecommerce inventory with easy-to-use APIs.
 On Instagram, moodboard accounts offer a clear initial growth strategy for Shuffles, and the #moodboard ( https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/moodboard/ ) hashtag has over 5.5 million posts. Accounts like @user_0192828192 ( https://www.instagram.com/user_0192828192/ ) (below) post multiple per day in what can be described as a form of self expression. Shuffles inserts a watermark on exported images, and seeding the app with Instagram moodboarders (alongside its success on TikTok) could kickstart adoption quickly.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

am Wochenende habe ich das Staffelfinale von ""Stranger Things"" gesehen.
 Ich war vermutlich nicht der Einzige, denn zwischenzeitlich sollen ja
sogar die Server von Netflix in die Knie gegangen sein. 

Was ich aber viel interessanter finde: Das Finale wurde offenbar unter
so großem Druck produziert, dass noch am Tag der Veröffentlichung eine
neue Version mit verbesserten Spezialeffekten hochgeladen wurde.

 Diese Form der Just-in-time-Produktion kannte ich sonst nur von uns bei
manchen Folgen des OMR Podcast... 

 Wir steigern zusammen den Arbeits-takt-takt-takt

Florian Heinemann hat mit dem Berliner Wagniskapitalgeber Project A
gerade einen neuen 350-Millionen-Fonds aufgelegt. Trotz des zuletzt
heftigen Gegenwinds für die Tech-Branche, ist er weiterhin
optimistisch. Im OMR Podcast spricht Heinemann über Marketing-Chancen
in der Krise, über riskante Geldanlagen in jungen Jahren - und
erklärt, warum er für eine Altersgrenze bei Venture-Capital-Fonds ist.

 Darum steht Tiktok gerade in den USA in der Kritik

Kein soziales Netzwerk ist in den vergangenen Jahren so rasant gewachsen
wie Tiktok. Die Relevanz der Bytedance-Tochter erkennt man auch daran,
dass Konkurrenten wie Instagram bereits versuchen, Tiktok-Features zu
kopieren. Doch gleichzeitig ist das Netzwerk extrem umstritten. Wir
haben uns die Vorwürfe einmal genau angeschaut.
 In den USA gibt es aktuell
zwei zentrale Debatten: 

Jugendschutz: Immer wieder wird Tiktok vorgeworfen, zu wenig für den
Schutz von Kindern- und Jugendlichen zu tun. Im Fokus steht aktuell
Tiktoks Vorgehen bei Videos, in denen es um die sogenannte
""Blackout-Challenge"" geht. Dabei wollen meist junge Menschen einen
Moment der Ohnmacht herbeiführen. Inzwischen werden mindestens sieben
Todesfälle von Kindern und Jugendlichen mit dieser Challenge in
Verbindung gebracht. Aktuell werden in den USA zwei Fälle vor Gericht
verhandelt, in denen sich junge Mädchen (8 und 9 Jahre) erhängt hatten
- offenbar wollten sie an der Challenge teilnehmen. Die Eltern werfen
Tiktok vor, dass der Algorithmus der App Videos dieser Challenge gezielt
an Kinder ausgespielt habe.

 Das Netzwerk hätte aus ihrer Sicht mehr unternehmen müssen, um das zu
unterbinden. Tiktok hatte gegenüber US-Medien betont, dass man
entsprechende Videos sofort entferne, sobald man sie finde.

 China-Kritik: Bereits Ex-US-Präsident Donald Trump versuchte, die
Verbreitung von Tiktok einzuschränken. Er begründete dies mit Sorgen
um die Daten von US-Bürgern. Das Thema ist noch nicht vom Tisch, denn
zusätzliche Brisanz erhielt es 2021, weil bekannt wurde, dass der
chinesische Staat sich an einer Bytedance-Tochterfirma beteiligt hatte
und auch einen Platz im Aufsichtsrat übernahm.

 Hinzu kam kürzlich ein Bericht von ""Buzzfeed""
,
laut dem Tiktok-Mitarbeiter in China monatelang Zugriff auf
nicht-öffentliche Informationen von US-Bürgern hatten. Bytedance hat
dies inzwischen bestätigt. Man teile aber keine Informationen mit der
chinesischen Regierung, versicherte Firmenchef Shou Zi Chew in einem
Brief an US-Senatoren.

 Worum es bei der Tiktok-Kritik noch geht - und warum manche Punkte
einem seltsam bekannt vorkommen, lest ihr hier in unserem Artikel.

  Newsbites: Meta, Cathie Wood, Jeff Bezos

Meta-Tests: Facebook hat damit begonnen, NFTs in Beiträgen zu testen.
 Für Mutterkonzern Meta ist das Metaverse das große Wachstumsthema. Die
ersten Ergebnisse waren laut Teilnehmern aber offenbar wenig
spektakulär.

 Wood-Stocks: Investorin Cathie Wood schichtet ihren Tech-Fonds Arkk um.
 Von Spotify-Aktien hat sich sich teilweise getrennt - und Tesla ist
nicht mehr die größte Position im Portfolio.

 Bezos-Boot: Amazon-Gründer Jeff Bezos lässt in Rotterdam aktuell eine
Yacht bauen, die für viel Aufregung sorgt - weil für den Transport
eine historische Brücke abgerissen werden sollte. Doch nun haben sich
die Pläne offenbar geändert.

schön euch kennenzulernen und danke an Tim (BCC) für das Intro! Ich habe

Ich bin Ruben und leite die größte Studenten-geführte Konferenz für

Ökosystem, und Größen wie *Neil Rimer* (Co-Founder Index Ventures), *Luciana
Lixandru* (Partner Sequoia) und *Julian Teicke* (Founder wefox).

 Ich werde vom *01-03.08 in München* sein, und wollte die Zeit nutzen um

   1. den Summit 2022 kurz zusammenfassen
   2. fragen, was euch gut gefallen hat und wo
   Verbesserungspotenzial besteht
   3. zeigen, was für ein *Mehrwert der Summit 2023 Picus bietet*

Ich werde *nicht länger als 30min* brauchen. Ich freue mich schon!

Beste Grüße,

While war, spiking energy prices, and energy shortages are not things to get excited about, the world is responding by seemingly putting more support behind sensible energy policies and decisions. Those decisions might leave humanity much better off in the long run. Crisis focuses, and leaves little room for bullshit.

It’s worth looking back and realizing we used to build much faster. The Empire State Building was built in 410 days [ https://substack.com/redirect/6ace2977-c8d6-4a1d-8bd5-7e8eb7be0a87?r=o1saq ]."
425_6,1662728276,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #11,"Today, 410 days would likely be about a quarter of the way through their NEPA review. The Golden Gate Bridge, a technological marvel of its time that was viewed as “the bridge that couldn’t be built”, took only about four years to build [ https://substack.com/redirect/282ceabc-f30e-4cd9-9d8d-8be33fa9e277?r=o1saq ]. A suicide prevention barrier on that same bridge was bid on in 2015, began construction in 2018, and isn’t due to be completed until 2023 [ https://substack.com/redirect/4615201d-f863-48a0-8bb6-4f45b9b1fb00?r=o1saq ]. Building the entirety of the Golden Gate Bridge with 1930s technology was faster than building a simple guardrail with today’s review process."

NEPA, passed in 1969, was likely well-intentioned: it requires extensive environmental reviews on federal actions which might “significantly affect” the environment. In practice, however, NEPA increases direct costs, delays projects, disincentives new projects and has few meaningful successes stories it can point to. In fact, as Johnson points out, NEPA has delayed or killed many explicitly environmental projects such as NYC’s congestion pricing plan, adding bike lands in San Francisco, and multiple solar wind projects off the coast of Massachusetts.

It would also be a blow to the faux-environmentalism movement that cares more about signaling than facts or results, and a move towards a new, more pragmatic, and ultimately more effective regime that enables both growth and new, cleaner energy sources.

"
425_14,1662728276,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #11,"The bill faced opposition from some environmental groups, citing nuclear safety concerns, and Assembly Democrats circulated a counterproposal to spend the money on building more solar and wind instead. However, a supermajority of both chambers — the required threshold for a bill to go into effect immediately — ultimately agreed.
 Speaking of which… In a somewhat surprising sign of common sense California legislation, last week state lawmakers voted to extend the operating life of the nuclear power plant at Diablo Canyon by an additional five years. The Diablo Canyon NPP is the state’s only such plant and its largest source of electricity, producing 9% of its total electricity and 15% of its clean energy. As California struggles with its energy future, it’s encouraging to see legislation like this extension pass.
 On the other end of the spectrum, Hawaii closed its last coal-fired power plant [ https://substack.com/redirect/d0b2e2dc-ac2d-4f9f-b3be-9cbab16a7451?r=o1saq ]. The AES Hawaii Power Plant, which produced 11% of the state’s electricity and was a major emitter of greenhouse gases, closed on Thursday. Energy is already very expensive in Hawaii — about 3x the average cost of the rest of the country — and this plant closure does not help: the typical person will see a 4% increase on their October energy bill directly due to this closure. But it’s another, albeit painful, step in the state’s complete coal ban plan. 
 Hawaii is the most petroleum-dependent state in the US with over four-fifths of its power coming from petroleum, but it was also the first to set a goal to have 100% of its power come from renewable sources (by 2045)."

 Erica Pandey [ https://substack.com/redirect/63c0e37f-4013-452b-b71e-88cf570fbe48?r=o1saq ] for Axios
Fifty-five years ago, interracial marriage was illegal in many states in the United States, until the Supreme Court decreed all anti-miscegenation laws illegal in 1967’s Loving v. Virginia. The first time Gallup polled Americans on the subject, in 1958, only 4% of Americans approved of interracial marriages. We only broke the 50% mark during my lifetime, in 1995.
 The most recent Gallup poll found that interracial marriage has a 94% approval rating among Americans, and that number is as high as 98% among 18-to-29-year-olds. Further, according to Pew Research, the percentage of interracial marriages has jumped from 3% in 1967 to 20% in 2022. 
 The data is heartening — it’s hard to find anything that 94 out of 100 Americans approve of — and it’s a nice reminder that despite the narratives in the news, America is a very tolerant country."

Rebecca McClellan [ https://substack.com/redirect/b0f2a86f-a0d4-43c7-a286-8619b5d1fd1e?r=o1saq ] for Stanford News
Stanford University researchers have built the most complex and well-defined synthetic microbiome, creating a community of over 100 bacterial species that was successfully transplanted into mice. The ability to add, remove, and edit individual species will allow scientists to better understand the links between the microbiome and health, and eventually develop first-in-class microbiome therapies.
 The microbiome has become a particularly popular area of scientific (and commercial — see: Athletic Greens ad at the top of this email) research & development over the past two decades. The microbiome isn’t any one “thing” and it’s different in every human — it’s the collection of hundreds of bacterial species that live in our digestive system. So while its importance has been known for at least the last decade, pinpointing exactly how it works and running control experiments on each of the bacteria has proven difficult. These Stanford Research built a microbiome from scratch — it consists of 119 different bacterial species, each of which can be added, removed, and manipulated — which will give researches a much clearer understanding of how each individual species impacts the larger microbiome and our health as a whole. 
 The New York Times has an excellent piece here [ https://substack.com/redirect/1aadc1e9-091f-4526-a2c2-1d82d49308ad?r=o1saq ] on the research team’s process and the potential impact of its work.

Peter Goodman [ https://substack.com/redirect/5d2f17f8-5d0b-4bf0-9144-80e8e5a183a8?r=o1saq ] for The New York Times
As Mr. Ray acknowledged, a key impediment to the more rapid deployment of automation is fear among workers that robots are a threat to their jobs. Once they realize that the robots are there not to replace them but merely to relieve them of physically taxing jobs like pushing carts, “it gets really fun,” Mr. Ray said."
425_21,1662728276,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #11,"“They realize it’s kind of cool.”
"
425_22,1662728276,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #11,"Spurred by the Covid-induced supply chain disruption and current labor shortages across almost every industry, companies are once again fully embracing automation and robotics. This is nothing new — even before the Great Supply Chain Disruption, companies knew that robots were cheaper, more productive, and and came with less baggage than human workers. During previous waves of automation (or ahead of potential waves of automation), the fear has been that robots would replace humans and leave millions of workers out of a job, or at the very least, worse off. That fear seems to be less pervasive today because, in the face of labor shortages, clogged supply chains, and on-shoring trends, we simply need more resources and productivity.
 Noah Smith (note: we try to avoid continuously promoting the same writers, but Noah has been on a months’ long hot streak which makes it almost impossible not to share his work) makes the case in “American workers need lots and lots of robots [ https://substack.com/redirect/29e4ff06-4e0c-4d64-8bee-4bc224af5e1f?r=o1saq ]” that not only does American need more robots, but that robots are actually good for the U.S. worker. Smith addresses the notion that robots will displace the American worker noting that basically everyone who wants a job, has a job — and that low-skill wages (the jobs most likely to be automated away) have actually steadily increased with automation. He also tends to agree with our argument above — if the U.S. is to reshore its industrial base from China, it needs to lean into its strength."
425_23,1662728276,notboring@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Weekly Dose of Optimism #11,"Our strength, relatively speaking, is not cheap and abundant labor, but rather capital and advanced technology."

427_16,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"In today’s piece, I’d like to share another: the letter to your future self.
 Let’s dive right in…
Introduction
Every year on my birthday, I write a letter to my future self.
 The idea of writing a letter to your future self certainly isn't new. In fact, the first time I did it was in middle school. A few days before my 8th grade graduation in June 2005, our entire class was required to write a letter to ourselves that would be delivered upon graduation from high school four years later.
 In June 2009, I received the letter in the mail."
427_17,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"It was a fun surprise considering I had completely forgotten about it!
 I opened the letter and recall being blown away.
"
427_18,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Apparently it was hard to take it seriously at age 14—the letter was filled with a bunch of silly, immature inside jokes—but it did have a few gems:
Reflections on the Present—most notably a desire to carve my own way rather than be defined by the impressive path that my older sister had established in high school.
 Goals for the Future—a lofty ambition to play baseball at Stanford, which I somehow did accomplish!
 But like most 18 year olds, I put the letter away in a filing cabinet and never thought about it again…
As fate would have it, on January 5, 2016—my 25th birthday—I was cleaning out some old files and found the letter.
 I immediately decided to re-ignite the practice...
How to Structure the Letter
In writing the first letter on my 25th birthday, the time horizon I decided upon was 5 years.
 Why 5 years?
"
427_19,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Anecdotally, I have found that 5 years is the amount of time in which meaningful life change happens. When I thought about my own life, there were significant differences in my situation, mental state, and ambitions from age 15 to 20 to 25, so it struck me as an appropriate interval for the letters.
 Note: 5 years was the number I chose, but you can adjust to your preferences. Some people may start with a 1-year time horizon to pull forward the opening process—that works too!
 The letter format is mostly unstructured, but I try to have some degree of content consistency across them.
 The four areas I am sure to address in each letter:
Reflections on the Present
Changes to Make
Goals for the Future
Fun & Crazy Predictions
A few specific topics within each:
Reflections on the Present
This is all about deconstructing the present. It functions as a deep journaling session that requires significant introspection.
"
427_20,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Some prompts that may help:
What is working?
 What isn't working?
 What is giving me energy?
 What is draining my energy?
 What relationships give me genuine pleasure?
 What relationships are toxic?
"
427_21,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,What is surprising me about the present
427_22,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"?
Are my current habits aligned with my goals?
 This portion of the letter is a bit of a brain dump—highly therapeutic.
 Changes to Make
This is a natural outflow of the reflections on the present.
 Review the responses to what is draining your energy, what relationships are toxic, and what habits are leading you away from your goals.
 What changes do these responses suggest I need to make in my life today?
 For every 1 degree a plane veers off course, it misses its target destination by 1 mile for every 60 miles flown. The lesson: Tiny deviations from the optimal course are amplified by time—off by a little now means off by a lot in 5 years.
 The ability to adjust in real time is critical.
 Goals for the Future
The key topics to cover related to goals:
What are my big picture, ambitious long-term goals?
 What are my short and medium-term goals that will set the appropriate trajectory?
Why am I trying to achieve them?
 What would winning the next 5 years look like?
What new habits or systems would be necessary to achieve these goals?
 What are my anti-goals? This is a new addition and *very* important.
 The goals section of the letter is my favorite part of the process."
427_23,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"It requires you to zoom in and out in a way that is very clarifying.
 Fun & Crazy Predictions
I finish each letter with some fun…
What are my crazy predictions for what the future will look like in 5 years?
 You're writing to your future self, so this is the chance to have some fun. These predictions tend to be pretty funny—and wrong!—when you read them in 5 years.
 Go crazy!
"
427_24,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Early Reactions & Learnings
Since I wrote the first one on my 25th birthday, I started opening the letters on my 30th birthday in 2021.
 A few early reactions and learnings from the opening process:
5 year plans are basically useless
I was way off on predicting where I'd be in 5 years.
 Life simply changes too much in a 5 year span—especially in your 20s and 30s."
427_25,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Having a 5 year plan is fine if it provides value via structure and focus, but recognize that it's probably going to have to adjust.
 Reject the dogmatic pursuit of 5 year plans—be nimble and agile as you grow.
 Focus on systems and habits
"
427_26,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"My reflection on the alignment of my systems and habits with my goals was the best predictor of my achievement of said goals.
 Making adjustments and course correcting habits in real time was the most impactful part of the reflection.
 The physical writing process forced a level of honesty and introspection that led to real changes.
"
427_27,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"Learn to dance sober
In my first letter, I expressed some disappointment:
""The only way I'm comfortable dancing in public is when I'm drunk."
427_28,1655899214,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Letter to Your Future Self,"I want to change that. ""
If you can dance in public while sober, you're truly comfortable with yourself.
 Let's all learn to dance—poorly but proudly!

We therefore cannot be confident that, were human civilization to end, some other technologically capable species would eventually take our place. And even if you think that there is a 90 percent chance this would happen, the remaining risk of the permanent end of civilization would still be great enough that reducing it should be a pressing moral priority.
 Does the Fermi Paradox - the conflict between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life and the estimated high probability of its existence - make you feel optimistic or anxious? Whether life exists far out there in the universe or not, it remains that the existence of human life on earth, mathematically speaking, is quite extraordinary. Will MacAskill, one of the originators of the Effective Altruism movement and a proponent of longtermism, explores the whether or not another a similar species would evolve if humans went extinct (nuclear war, climate disaster, etc.)"

For the first time, China has slightly edged out the United States in the number of most cited papers, a key measure of research impact, according to a Japanese science policy institute. The milestone provides fresh evidence that China’s scholarship, known for its burgeoning quantity, is catching up in quality as well.
 China, for the first time, has inched past the U.S. in the number of most cited papers. China has outnumbered the U.S. in the quantity of research it has produced for a number of years, but the citations measurement is important because it shows that quality of China’s research may also have improved. There is still some skepticism around this measurement — research paper mills, incestuous citation rings, etc., all discussed by Noah Smith here [ https://substack.com/redirect/db27348c-6c63-4d2f-beef-f39743c27324?r=o1saq ] — but it’s another sign that China is gaining in the “science race.”
 On its face, this isn’t an optimistic story from the western perspective, but it is a good example of the kind of optimism we write about here. The David Deutsch Principle of Optimism states that: “All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.”

Eliminating the optional 12-month publication embargo for federally funded peer-reviewed research articles.
 Making data published in peer-reviewed research articles immediately available upon publication.
 What this means in practice is that tax-payer funded research can no longer sit behind a paywall in scientific journals. The policy changes were designed to bring transparency and increased accessibility to the American scientific discovery process. Perhaps more importantly, it is yet another sign in the past few weeks that the administration is focused on revitalizing the American scientific research engine and leaning into America’s relative strengths: openness and bottoms-up innovation.

Carl Zimmer [ https://substack.com/redirect/0a8ee64a-7d21-4eaa-8e74-8e554d5f9e27?r=o1saq ] for The New York Times
A team of scientists has found a cheap, effective way to destroy so-called forever chemicals, a group of compounds that pose a global threat to human health…The chemicals — known as PFAS [ https://substack.com/redirect/7cf94cef-452b-4e3d-85ce-96a1e4b1f042?r=o1saq ], or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — are found in a spectrum of products and contaminate water and soil around the world…In a study, published [ https://substack.com/redirect/96c7e3ef-b567-4278-953f-37cc6107579b?r=o1saq ] Thursday in the journal Science, a team of researchers rendered PFAS molecules harmless by mixing them with two inexpensive compounds at a low boil. In a matter of hours, the PFAS molecules fell apart.
 If you’ve ever seen the 2018 Netflix documentary, The Devil We Know [ https://substack.com/redirect/db0911e0-fd99-4a3d-adc8-1de7d5de314c?r=o1saq ], this story should bring you some measure of relief. The doc investigated the health hazards from PFAs, a key ingredient found in Teflon which can be found in many household items, most famously the non-stick pan. The tricky thing with PFAs is that they are remarkably hard to get rid of and can contaminate water, soil, and the environment over long periods of time. Historically, we’ve had little recourse in destroying PFAs, but this new study shows that a relatively “simple” methodology may provide a cheap, effective way to destroy so-called forever chemicals. Still, the researchers warn that the most effective solution in lowering PFA levels is reducing new PFAs introduced into the environment.
(4) Startup’s Hydrogen Breakthrough May Give New Life to Coal Plants [ https://substack.com/redirect/c3cb13a5-8c74-4cc2-8f9e-4d7d734369e7?r=o1saq ]
Swati Pandey [ https://substack.com/redirect/03b3b29b-9a9c-49f2-8ae9-0c126ea2c0bf?r=o1saq ] for Bloomberg
Bottled hydrogen and oxygen are fed into a glass cylinder containing the secret catalyst, which quickly turns orange as it heats up to around 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit). If the technology can scale up, it could ultimately allow power plant operators that burn coal to retrofit generators to run on green hydrogen without having to construct a completely new plant.
 Chalk it up as founding myth lore, but whether this startup “stumbled” on a new way to convert hydrogen into heat without burning it or not is less important than the discovery itself. The technology, once scaled for commercial use, could allow coal-powered power plants to retrofit generators to run on green hydrogen, instead of building new green plants from scratch. 
 Here’s a non-scientist take on why this is important: power-plants run on generators —> generators are powered by steam engines —> steam is created when water is heated —> traditionally, heat is created by burning coal —> carbon dioxide is a biproduct of burning coal —> CO2 is a major contributor to greenhouse effect. The breakthrough here is that, by using a secret catalyst, the startup, Star Scientific, can turn hydrogen and oxygen directly into steam, without burning anything. The process can be plugged into existing coal-powered plants — ripping out the coal and replacing it with Star Scientific’s french press-like device — making the whole thing faster and more efficient than building new plants.

The AI image generator built by independent researchers is the latest in the AI hot streak that Roose describes in the article, which includes Open AI’s GPT-3 and DALL•E 2, AlphaGo and AlphaFold from Google’s DeepMind, and Googles LaMDA, which convinced an engineer [ https://substack.com/redirect/00bd44ea-4880-4b7f-971f-320bd85676cd?r=o1saq ] it was sentient. Recently, John Carmack, the creator of Doom and former CTO of Meta’s Oculus, announced his new startup, Keen Technologies, which is tackling Artificial General Intelligence.
 After a long period in which AI was “just a few years away,” it seems that the “golden age” of AI is upon us. It should generate a flood of benefits and challenges alike, including what some believe to be the biggest existential risk to humanity: adversarial AI that wipes out the human race. Roose argues that the technology is coming either way, and encourages everyone to read up and get prepared.

439_2,1663963404,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Need funding for your startup? We can help.,"Hey friends,

If you’re a first-time founder or run a startup overseas, raising
a pre-seed or seed round while navigating the US venture capital
scene can feel daunting.

 You might wonder how you’re going to get the attention of
investors when you have few or no existing relationships, or even
know what materials you’ll need to prepare or how to prepare
them.

 This is something we hear often from some of the founders in the
GoingVC network.

 So, we decided to do something about it.

"
439_3,1663963404,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Need funding for your startup? We can help.,"After helping 450+ professionals break into venture capital,
creating a network of 3000+ early-stage investors, investing in
24+ companies with 2 exits and 1 unicorn, we are super excited to
announce the GoingVC Investment Readiness Program!

 What is GoingVC’s Investment Readiness Program (IRP)?

"
439_4,1663963404,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Need funding for your startup? We can help.,"This program is specifically designed for first time founders or
non-US founders looking to raise capital from US investors at
pre-seed or seed stage."
439_5,1663963404,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Need funding for your startup? We can help.,"Throughout the six-month program, founders will be trained on the
following key topics related to fundraising:

* The Behind-the-scenes VC Investment Process
* Creating Winning Pitching Assets
* Due Diligence & Data Room Preparation
* Early-Stage Valuation
* Creating Your Financial Model
* Forming Your Board
* How to present to Investors
 * Negotiation Tactics
* Exit Strategy Planning

​

Founders will also get hands-on mentoring from our seasoned team
members who will carefully select investors for your company from
our network of 3000+ (VCs, angels, family offices), set up 1:1
meetings with those investors, all while helping you execute the
completion of your fundraising round and get the best terms."
439_6,1663963404,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Need funding for your startup? We can help.,"Who is the Program for?

You should consider this program if you:

* Have a solid product, team and a well-defined GTM strategy and
fundraising from US investors is your primary pain point at this
stage.
 * Are a first-time founder looking to raise capital from US VCs.
 * Are a non-US founder looking to raise capital from US VCs,
provided you had raised capital from non-US VCs.
 * Have some commitments to your round from angel investors/family
offices and you are looking to find a lead US VC.

We just opened up applications for our inaugural cohort.

 However, we’re only accepting five founders so the sooner you

Webflow has changed a ton since we launched in August of 2013 — evolving from 
a single-page site builder to a powerful platform used by hundreds of thousands 
of businesses to run mission-critical websites.

 We’re updating our pricing to reflect the continued evolution of our platform 
and to ensure we continue growing alongside our customers for decades to come. 
 These updates will become visible in your account over the next few days — but 
here’s what you can expect:

We’re increasing Site plan prices

For the first time since 2016, we’re increasing Site plan prices to reflect the
evolution of our product 

 and all the functionality we’ve added the past six years, as well as future 
releases and continued investment in our platform.

 Here’s what you can expect:

 * Basic (annual): $12 → $14 per month 
 * Basic (monthly): $15 → $18 per month 
 * CMS (annual): $16 → $23 per month 
 * CMS (monthly): $20 → $29 per month 
 * Business (annual): $36 → $39 per month 
 * Business (monthly): $45 → $49 per month

We know price changes can be challenging, especially for those of you who work 
with clients. To ease the transition, we’re automatically extending a grace 
period during which you canpurchase a new Site plan or upgrade an existing one 
at legacy prices until December 31, 2022. These sites will keep legacy pricing 
until their first renewal in 2023.

Learn more about the grace periods here 

.

 We’re committed to our mission of empowering you to build for the web, and we 
believe that these changes will help ensure that we can continue improving 
Webflow for decades to come.

gamey. (3) Ethically, I feel great about Maui Nui protein, as
axis deer are an invasive species on Maui, where their population
needs to be managed in order to protect vulnerable ecosystems.

 Harvested using stress-free methods, Maui Nui’s fresh venison is
clean-tasting, tender, and one of the most nutrient-dense meats
on the planet. Maui Nui is a nearly daily go-to for me, both as a
supplement to my daily diet (with broth, jerky snacks, etc.) and
through main courses (via their fresh-meat subscription program).

With the introduction of stablecoins, users should be able to lower not only costs but also volatility.

 Among other stablecoins, we believe Circle’s USDC, the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/MW5xVrB9jyKW5Bnz2t2Xn2yxW1-ywb14QJdK2N1-yX_G3pdrrV1-WJV7CgNH6W18F7Zx1yvZ2jW1q7d_S8J_fM1W1cvdc96Hk96dW1twRCk2qMLHRW24Rmq-39yhYHVXh1bg3MJRPkN4Yx9YY29qzZW8fjpCX6SSbGDW2gkT6l8MVrtWN3K4BSR43ny8W6FwGcz2kWHwqN7Vbn-N83BxJW75DLV66YbmccW2Vm0Zb4Gbzn-W7c4RK_8cMmd6W5vQ2d08W0WbGW85vrPm4X-lVKW93JHMy2Y70VGW30q3zv111N9XW6CDvlf37X0_1W7M7Psv80sx1ZW883YVm9jt4ltW4vqCt47MJmW2W8jWD7C5QsgJR3pjx1 ) , is likely to facilitate a bridge for cross-border payments.

According to new research by Meta, the Make-A-Video (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/MW5xVrB9jyKW5Bnz2t2Xn2yxW1-ywb14QJdK2N1-yX_m3pdr7V1-WJV7CgQnXW8Y0Dhx6XSbHDW794Tv01WKP0LW193hwZ904ndtW7dnSv14nHfC1W4r-nPw2BvjGZMTK6kp5ssJZW2pMbN11q_xNsW6xfV1R1Dv6JWW7k8x3z4c8ydsW8SGdqv8pzFg3W2ClJWb241SsMW2nbK707cVNq5W7s09SJ2B3g84VQKKHb1HhqCmW2zs6dX3fKMcvW3-Pqlh5dzXrDW2fq4-T95Dxf2W5gY-n23ZbT8cW7h4GNx5mwXTQW8B8Q3h4RC5HlW59L19V1shr7BW5MbNfK7JHKj239S31 ) model circumvents the obstacles by using existing text-to-image model frameworks in conjunction with unsupervised learning on unpaired video data. Combining the two approaches, Meta enabled its text-to-image model to learn realistic motion, allowing Make-A-Video to produce short videos without audio.

 Meta’s website illustrates different ways for users to interact with Make-A-Video, (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/MW5xVrB9jyKW5Bnz2t2Xn2yxW1-ywb14QJdK2N1-yX_m3pdr7V1-WJV7CgQnXW8Y0Dhx6XSbHDW794Tv01WKP0LW193hwZ904ndtW7dnSv14nHfC1W4r-nPw2BvjGZMTK6kp5ssJZW2pMbN11q_xNsW6xfV1R1Dv6JWW7k8x3z4c8ydsW8SGdqv8pzFg3W2ClJWb241SsMW2nbK707cVNq5W7s09SJ2B3g84VQKKHb1HhqCmW2zs6dX3fKMcvW3-Pqlh5dzXrDW2fq4-T95Dxf2W5gY-n23ZbT8cW7h4GNx5mwXTQW8B8Q3h4RC5HlW59L19V1shr7BW5MbNfK7JHKj239S31 ) not only generating variations on user-inputted videos but also specifying video styles––”surreal”/ “realistic” / “stylized”––and inferring motion based on users’ static images or image pairs. While the commercialization of synthetic video is at an early stage, the pace of AI research has advanced significantly this year. Make-A-Video seems to have many use cases, from digital video art to the facilitation of digital ad synthesis. That said, Meta has yet to release Make-A-Video to the public who will battle test it.

 Prime editing adds new functionality to the CRISPR-Cas9 protein and is the most recent gene-editing technology to emerge from Dr. David Liu’s laboratory at the Broad Institute, Harvard University, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).

 In living cells, prime editing can copy parts of a DNA sequence into a targeted site without cutting the DNA’s double strand, or double helix. Double-strand DNA breaks can cause uncontrolled “indels”––insertions or deletions––as well as cell changes like translocations, p53 activation, chromothripsis, and other deletions at the target site. Like base editing, its predecessor, prime editing avoids these undesired outcomes.

 In prime editing, the “Prime Editor Guide RNA” (pegRNA) guides the Cas9 protein to the correct DNA sequence and specifies which part of the edited sequence should be inserted. Then, the disabled Cas9 protein nicks one strand of the DNA. Then, the engineered reverse transcriptase fuses to the Cas9 protein and copies the edited sequence into the cell host’s DNA at the nicked target site. The cell then incorporates the edited DNA sequence into its genome, creating a permanent change. Because researchers can direct any sequence with dozens of nucleotides to replace the starting sequence, prime editing appears to be more precise and versatile than CRISPR-Cas9, which disrupts genes but does not correct them.

 Prime editing could be a tremendous step forward for gene editing and its ever-growing toolbox of capabilities."

2-Minute Rule 
“If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it’s defined.”
Don’t let small tasks add up and create a mental overhang. 
 Do it on the spot if <2-minutes, decline to action it, or schedule it for a specific future date.

Attention Residue
Every time you switch from one task to another, part of your attention remains with one task or your previous task.
 This prevents you from concentrating intensely ('deep work') and inhibits overall productivity.
 Lesson: Don't multi-task.

Cognitive Switching Penalty
Every time you switch your attention from one subject to another, you incur this penalty.
 Your brain spends time and energy thrashing, loading, and reloading contexts.

457_3,1656065938,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Podcasts vom Computer,"Wochen auf einer Hochzeit eingeladen - und es gibt
ein Problem. Zwei Pandemie-Jahre mit durchgehendem Homeoffice haben eine
gewisse Entfremdung bei mir und meinem Anzug ausgelÃ¶st. Unfreundlicher
gesagt: Ich bin zu dick geworden. Nun habe ich Ã¼berlegt, ob ich es
schaffe, trotz Super-Grill-Wetter in sechs Wochen fÃ¼nf bis sieben Kilo
abzunehmen, um wieder reinzupassen. 

 Doch die Krise bei den ModehÃ¤ndlern zwingt mich ja geradezu dazu, mir
lieber einen neuen Anzug zu kaufen, um einen kleinen Beitrag zur
Sicherung vieler tausend ArbeitsplÃ¤tze zu leisten. Wenn ich mir abends
nochmal nachnehme, leiste ich im Grunde einen Dienst an meinem Land.
 Gern geschehen.

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN

 Zalando wird zum Sinnbild der Krise im Online-Handel 

Mehr als zehn Prozent Kursverlust nach BÃ¶rsenstart zeigen ziemlich
deutlich , wie Anleger die Lage beim Mode-HÃ¤ndler Zalando aktuell
einschÃ¤tzen: ziemlich kritisch. Der Berliner Konzern hat am
Donnerstagabend nach BÃ¶rsenschluss seine Erwartungen fÃ¼r das
Gesamtjahr drastisch nach unten korrigiert. Und Zalando ist nicht der
einzige Online-HÃ¤ndler mit Problemen.

 Was ist bei Zalando los? Die hohen Inflationsraten angesichts der unter
anderem fÃ¼r Energie drastisch gestiegenen Preise sorgen offenbar
dafÃ¼r, dass viele Verbraucher:innen sich doppelt und dreifach
Ã¼berlegen, ob sie wirklich eine neue Hose, Jacke oder Schuhe brauchen.
 Der vermeintliche Schrei vor GlÃ¼ck ist dadurch seltener zu hÃ¶ren als
in der Vergangenheit - was fÃ¼r Zalando natÃ¼rlich keine guten
Nachrichten sind. Schon zu Jahresbeginn mussten die Berliner erstmals in
ihrer Firmengeschichte einen UmsatzrÃ¼ckgang bekanntgeben, was
angesichts der starken Zahlen wÃ¤hrend des vergangenen Corona-Jahres
auch irgendwie erwartbar war. Die jetzigen AnkÃ¼ndigungen (der Umsatz
soll nur noch maximal um drei Prozent statt um zwÃ¶lf bis 19 Prozent
wachsen)

haben anscheinend doch viele Analysten Ã¼berrascht. Zu den allgemeinen
Problemen kommen offenbar auch noch interne wie etwa Managementfehler,
berichtete zuletzt das ""Manager Magazin"".

 Â 

Wie sieht die Lage insgesamt aus? Auch viele andere Unternehmen haben zu
kÃ¤mpfen. So schrumpften auch schon beim Handelsriesen Amazon im ersten
Quartal die UmsÃ¤tze. Der Branchenverband BEVH hat seine Umsatzprognose
fÃ¼r den Online-Handel in Deutschland auch schon nach unten korrigiert
.
 Und Shopify kÃ¼ndigte in dieser Woche an, sich kÃ¼nftig auch auf das
B2B-GeschÃ¤ft konzentrieren zu wollen.
 Damit
wollen die Kanadier ihre Wachstumsgeschichte fortschreiben - und
umgekehrt unabhÃ¤ngiger werden von den vielen D2C-Anbietern, die
mithilfe von Shopify aktuell ihre Shops betreiben und genau wie Zalando
angesichts der Inflation unter der ZurÃ¼ckhaltung der Konsument:innen
leiden."
457_5,1656065938,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Podcasts vom Computer,"Welche Folgen hat das? Sinkende UmsÃ¤tze und Gewinne auf breiter Front
kÃ¶nnen die Vorboten einer AbwÃ¤rtsspirale sein. Um der
entgegenzuwirken, hat Zalando kÃ¼rzlich die Mehrheit am bei der jungen
Zielgruppe beliebte Streetwear Magazin und Fashion Label High Snobiety
gekauft. Gleichzeitig will das Unternehmen an Marketingausgaben sparen.
 Das hat Zalando bereits im vergangenen Quartal angekÃ¼ndigt.

 Auch der Abbau von Stellen wird vielerorts bereits diskutiert oder
exerziert.

Teures Tempo: Viele Kunden finden es angenehm, sich von
Quick-Commerce-Anbietern in wenigen Minuten ihre Lebensmittel nach Hause
liefern zu lassen - dafÃ¼r bezahlen wollen sie offenbar nicht. Das
zeigen Daten beim US-Anbieter Gopuff in den USA, aber auch von Gorillas
und Getir in Deutschland.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

wenn Gründer:innen oder andere spannende Menschen für eine
Podcast-Aufnahme zu uns ins Office nach Hamburg kommen, gibt es zwar
kein Standardprozess, trotzdem sind die Abläufe fast immer sehr
ähnlich. Man geht gemeinsam durch das Büro, stellt Teams vor, erzählt
ein paar Anekdoten. 

 Als ich vergangene Woche die Yfood-Gründer Noël Bollmann und Benjamin
Kremer empfangen habe, war es dann aber doch etwas anders. Irgendwie ist
aus dem Small Talk ein sehr ausführliches Vorgespräch geworden, das
gezeigt hat: Die brennen für ihre Idee und Produkte. Im"

Podcast mit Philipp Westermeyer beweisen sie das ebenfalls -
überzeugt Euch am besten selber."

Statt Döner und Burger: Wie Yfood mit gesundem Mahlzeitenersatz zum
Unicorn werden will

Im Studium und später als Bänker fehlt Noël Bollmann und Benjamin
Kremer häufig die Zeit, selber zu kochen und sie greifen zu Döner,
Burger & Co. Weil es im Convenience-Food-Bereich an gesunden
Alternativen mangelt , entwickeln sie kurzerhand selber eine. Erst ist
Yfood nur eine Trinkmahlzeit, heute umfasst das Portfolio des
Unternehmens rund 30 Produkte inklusive warmen Gerichten, die online und
 im Einzelhandel verkauft werden. Im OMR Podcast verraten die Gründer,
welche Rolle skurrile Nischeninfluencer:innen beim Wachstum gespielt
haben

- und wie sie bis 2026 einen Jahresumsatz von 600 Millionen Euro
erreichen wollen.

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN

 Wie die Shopping-Flaute Zalando und Ebay trifft

Dass eine Konsumflaute kommen würde, war zu erwarten. Die
Inflationsrate und damit auch die Preise steigen seit Monaten,
Deutschland steht kurz vor einer Rezession. Anhand von Geschäftszahlen
großer E-Commerce-Player lassen sich entsprechende Trends gut erkennen.
 Und das trifft auch für Zalando und Ebay zu, die jetzt ihre Zahlen für
das zweite Quartal des Jahres veröffentlicht haben.

 Zalando: Der Umsatz des Fashion-Onliners ging im Vergleich zum
Vorjahresquartal um vier Prozent auf 2,6 Milliarden Euro zurück
.
 Beim bereinigten operativen Ergebnis, dem Ebit, stehen nur noch 77 statt
 184 Millionen Euro wie im Vorjahr. Im ersten Quartal stand hier
allerdings ein Verlust von 52 Millionen Euro. Leicht aufwärts ging es
bei der Anzahl der Bestellungen, um drei Prozent auf 67,8 Millionen. 

 Ebay: Auch beim Marktplatz-Pionier ging der Umsatz zurück, um neun
Prozent auf 2,4 Milliarden US-Dollar
.
 Das Non-GAAP Net Income, also das Ergebnis aus dem operativem Geschäft
und das Einbeziehen von zum Beispiel M&A-Aktivitäten, sank um 18
Prozent auf 554 Millionen US-Dollar. Auch die Zahl der aktiven
Kund:innen ging zurück, um elf Prozent auf 135 Millionen.

Keine Zukunft: Zum ersten Oktober wird Facebook seine

monetarisieren. Meta begründet den Schritt mit dem klaren Fokus auf das
Kurzvideo-Format Reels

Kurzvideo-Reichweiten zu monetarisieren. Eine Partnerschaft mit der
Ticket-Plattform Ticketmaster soll es ausgewählten Creator:innen jetzt
ermöglichen, in Videos direkt auf den Kartenverkauf von zum Beispiel
Konzerten zu verlinken
.
 User könnten dann innerhalb der App kaufen. 

Shopify & Klaviyo: Kurz nachdem Shopifys CEO Tobi Lütke die Entlassung
von rund 1.000 Mitarbeitenden verkünden musste, gibt die
Shopping-Plattform jetzt ein strategisches Investment von 100 Millionen
US-Dollar in die Marketing-Plattform Klaviyo bekannt

Welcome to a Technically dispatch [ https://substack.com/redirect/a607119d-b20a-4089-a13a-c0591c8ac0e8?r=o1saq ], where we quickly explain major events in the news that relate to software and technical things. The NYT released an “investigation” [ https://substack.com/redirect/7c7a9900-a3bd-4de5-8e19-40d7f518571e?r=o1saq ] tearing down LinkedIn for their A/B testing this week, and everyone on Twitter has been talking about it. LinkedIn wasn’t shy about this, and didn’t try to hide it: they literally published an academic paper [ https://substack.com/redirect/fc2099ee-891a-4628-9ce0-a512cfe01c7c?r=o1saq ] analyzing the results this month.

Engineers, product teams, and before product teams exist, founders, are responsible for figuring out what features and products they should be building."
472_5,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"But how do you know what your customers want? And what if they’re wrong? 
 Experimentation is one of the ways that companies understand if their product efforts are working, and ipso facto, what they should be spending time on. The basic idea is that instead of trying to understand what your users might want before you build it: 
Try building a small version of it,
Launch it to a small percentage of your existing users,
Measure what impact it has on their behavior,
Learn and try again
You may have heard about A/B testing in the context of changing the color of a button on a site, but this a very reductive view of things. Companies experiment on plenty of big, meaningful features too. It’s simply a way of trying new stuff out without rolling it out to your entire user base. The early feedback you get helps you understand if it’s a good feature, a bad one, or most commonly, something in the middle.
 An example – imagine you’re a product manager at Amazon, and you want to understand what impact a new price comparison tool might have on purchase behavior. Would viewers have a better experience and buy more stuff, quicker? Or would it make them think more about cost, and they’d buy less?"
472_6,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,Or maybe one of a million other possibilities
472_7,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"you can’t foresee? 
"
472_8,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"To experiment, you’d build a basic version of this tool and launch it to a small percentage of traffic to Amazon.com. You’d then measure the purchase behavior (total $$, average $$, or something like that) between the groups, and compare them. If the group that used the tool bought more, that’s good signal you should invest more in building it out.
 Because of the statistics of sampling, you usually need a meaningfully sized base of users to run proper, statistically significant experiments. So this practice is usually reserved for mid to later stage companies, not early-early-early stage startups."
472_9,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"But the philosophy of experimentation still holds for those companies: sometimes it’s worth building a basic version of something and seeing how people react to it (even if it’s just a focus group).

Who sees the feature and who doesn’t needs to be completely random, or you can introduce bias into your experiment results. And you also need to keep track of who sees it and who doesn’t, so you can tie that data back to subsequent user behavior and see what impact the experiment had.

472_14,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"Basically, there’s some real engineering work involved here."
472_15,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"It’s popular for engineering teams to outsource their feature flagging to tools like LaunchDarkly [ https://substack.com/redirect/1a5d9a87-30db-4b48-a347-d804f9757fd4?r=o1saq ].
 Measuring metrics
As part of setting up an experiment properly, you need to figure out how you’ll know if it’s working. Most experiments will have a top level metric that you’ll look to."
472_16,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"For our Amazon example above, it’s something like purchase volume. For other experiments it could be something like time on page, conversion rate, whether or not a user upgraded their plan, etc. 
 They say you shouldn’t look at your experiment metrics until enough users have seen it and it reaches statistical significance, but…most data teams I’ve worked with do.
 Run time and statistical significance
When you’re running an experiment, you’re doing inferential statistics — you’re basically assuming that whatever your little group of test subjects does will be representative of your entire user base. And with that assumption comes some statistical baggage, namely that you need this “sample” to be big enough. If you hear teams talking about “waiting to reach statistical significance” what they mean is waiting until the sample size is large enough to be representative of the whole population (all users)."
472_17,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"Experimentation and statistics are two sides of the same coin. 
 Managing experiment volume
When you have one experiment going on at once, things are straightforward enough. But when you have multiple going on at once, driven by different teams, you need some system to know which users are in which experiments. Ideally you want a user to only see one experiment at a time, but even that has complications.
 These are a few of the basics, but there’s a lot more to worry about, especially as you have more and more experiments running in parallel."

So LinkedIn was running experiments – so is every single startup (and probably public company) with enough users. AirBnB has written extensively about their experimentation culture [ https://substack.com/redirect/3438fdec-cef0-437b-9612-daff5605114d?r=o1saq ], as has Uber [ https://substack.com/redirect/f6a286ac-6c16-4313-8558-79f1f1110ad5?r=o1saq ], Lyft [ https://substack.com/redirect/a0fcd741-e3bd-43ba-8749-06f02ce3d68a?r=o1saq ], and many, many others."

"
472_22,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"The issue that the Times brings up is the ethical implications of such large scale experimentation:
But the changes made by LinkedIn are indicative of how such tweaks to widely used algorithms can become social engineering experiments with potentially life-altering consequences for many people. Experts who study the societal impacts of computing said conducting long, large-scale experiments on people that could affect their job prospects, in ways that are invisible to them, raised questions about industry transparency and research oversight.
 The idea is that in the pursuit of improving the product, companies like LinkedIn try things that could have serious impacts on the career prospects of their users. With a company like AirBnB or Uber, the stakes are lower. But for social media, there are higher stakes here – a profile view or a new connection could mean the difference between getting a great new job, or being stuck in the one you hate."
472_23,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"This rings true for me for sure.

472_24,1664209390,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,[Technically dispatch] what is A/B testing and what did LinkedIn do --  wrong,"But more rigorously, I’m not sure the logic really holds, because that would mean LinkedIn shouldn’t really launch or improve anything ever (what if it negatively impact’s someone’s career prospects?), and without experimentation there’s really no way for them to understand what impact anything has. I’m not sure these are “experiments on people” as much as they’re small tweaks to a free software product that you voluntarily choose to use."

Tuesday night, I appeared on a BBC radio show to discuss the business headlines of the week. Naturally, the host wanted to talk about the Supreme Courtâ€™s recent overturning of Roe v. Wade, and I came prepared with the facts: how the final decision compared to the leaked draft opinion from May, how a segment of America is, in fact, very happy about the decision, and how companies are responding. Â What I should have been prepared for, apparently, was the host commenting that many American women* are now questioning what it means to be female and then a follow-up question about how I feel about being a woman in the U.S. at this moment."

Despite the COVID crisis and supply chain bottlenecks that hampered production and sales for two years, companies like Tesla, Xpeng, and Nio enjoyed exponential growth rates that few auto analysts expected.

 Delving into our EV forecast for the next five years, once again we can see the difference between the linear growth rates powering most forecasts and the exponential growth derived from Wright’s Law. According to Wright’s Law (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74PqtB3pdrrV1-WJV7CgXwZW8WwNTB3WhtrsW422l116bmTBNN35dMy-t-1DrW2KvlYr5TTRlGW8LycPx51pgzcW4jNjbW1CmF39N16sQrNXDn7bW3lQkdc4FY-xyW9hkqJ_1nYQ6zW6hm0NX1P2NN6W4-hT1W8fQFWbVh-hbw3Rfs1DN2shqvrkNxV_W4P8DGC17ypDFW3GQdKH2pRqQlV3zVZt69Wrd_W5lZdRg8qXYMDN4C8Bvp1Y2stW1g5f-S41p_K_W3KgXnn22b7GCVlMr6K8Jy1ZqW6tvJWX2Lsc22W18JWcV2nJfw6W1K_RM-4dgvvX31GZ1 ) , every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced results in a consistent percentage decline in costs that increases the affordability and uptake of new products like EVs. Driven from Wright’s Law increasing EV affordability, we believe the diffusion curve below has captured the trajectory of EV sales quite effectively during the past 10 years.

 Applying that adoption curve to the next five years, we are projecting that, in the absence of autonomous taxi platforms, EV sales will increase more than six-fold to 45 million units, or more than double the 20 million consensus expectation (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74Pqv93pds1V1-WJV7CgSGyV256nR34-_YlW4r_wCQ3mMsXfW8-T2Y-5KpScKVDK1z87NfYT3W2M1HlM5G_rG8W93HYjX219bgWW11PRVp7PxKKVW1kwklB8YHH-HVNmFPp2fFD04W12Jw6J8TtwCGW4YH23V8XMv2DV2-ZH85ty3NJW94cVG12p6fM6VRljS-4VvZ7yW3PrwgF1wbjR1N4cyl-8PCmTSVWfK4Z5CDd3qN3ggdWfY3JLnW5TVzVS1CBX6gW1DJQWg6szfycW1pyDvR8FnWMPW6lxM40438JnFW6j8fJ08jKw3CW1r4b_k4r8xFmW1bpP5k8L5p8YVDMcVS4fZs20W3_hvVn7gRjYLW46-DkH3s9p_w3pcr1 ) . The difference between 20 million and 45 million units can be characterized by linear and exponential growth curves, respectively, as shown below."
477_7,1663593181,ark@arkinvest.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,"The Increase In Electric Vehicles Sales Is Likely To Be --  Exponential, Not Linear, and More...","Exponential growth curves also are described as S-curves (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74PqtB3pdrrV1-WJV7CgX4yW1bYbTz7VJkJlW4hBFDn8cVTxcN2LSCm9DjkpTW54N3X01VBgP6W8kZCbQ8CjKzFW67Y9Ll3SSnzpN2qpKjc6FRHhW6bFkPq32RxH8W95XdpQ5n01FLW73PNCl7Vds0_W9ghGXJ1VtQwyVH8_Jh5sZGlTW4pcbKk7Y58fhVsFmWW4mhxL3VvT-Cj4xMYtmW4HM0RH2qFC1MW66zvzc43MxqyW1wSsd480VtYJW34H5Zy6H1k8fF79rttTfZFtN7ZjsxpvrS1PVDXfN53hYl7FW7MDyrT7B75NPW8dpQjf1MSh2d3lKx1 ) .

 If autonomous technology takes hold as we expect, then the EV S-curve adoption cycle should feed an autonomous S-curve adoption cycle, turbocharging EV sales nearly eight-fold during the next five years, from ~7.5 million in 2022 to ~59 million in 2027, as shown below. In other words, barring another infectious disease crisis, concomitant supply chain bottlenecks, or any other disaster, our 59 million projection for 2027 would be nearly triple the 20 million consensus forecast, as shown below.

Cruise Is Heading To Austin And Phoenix

Last week in San Francisco, I took a ride in one of Cruise’s fully autonomous vehicles, with no human behind the wheel or in the passenger seat. The ride was smooth, though slow, with only one unexpected braking event when the car responded to motorcyclists weaving through traffic. Currently available only during nighttime hours in limited areas of San Francisco, the service should become more convenient “soon” once Cruise expands its hours and service area.

 Management recently announced plans to expand Cruise service to Austin and Phoenix by the end of the year (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74Pqth5mNYkV3Zsc37CgMhDW3MYLmv59p3MTW70Jx9S70vX4pW2CMCKM6SWKMYW1K9Sj77s6tpXW2t4Mdq1vZlccW72nNRk7hpFzRVtdKZD18YzMFW3JYv6l8GW-DLVj7T3p43nNhHN27przYHtm91W8B5WvN8sx2PNW76Y31d43rl2BW2BF0S-1x3J81MZ7Z5QzW8zbVJ1RLl88ncqgW5-jCZv1VDPFvW4XWJBZ70Gt33W3rnTZn3vy0DDN7Ps_-GZl_YDW8qSZqM3mn5pZW8Ghbvz7RF12sN78ZddRr7xMSW2NglCl3DW9ktN1X-JfTgkLH3W23NvC-8y6J5KVzCH7f5SSqTtN21dRPdzVmN5N6PfQ6j_TlbJW8X6GZ_1CVF88VrHgFX5RGNTxW8pYlFr152NGmW8K77Kh6ks2FkW9fYzbh9hMw9_W1MlklT5Kq07BW22C6rv5zYzFvW1Tj_NF7KWsgjW1X-y9b7ghqNmMNb9TcKZ1th34LM1 ) . Perhaps enabling this expansion is a shift away from high-definition (HD) maps, which are extremely detailed 3D visualizations created by systems of lasers called LiDAR used as the “base truth” against which to compare real-time road conditions. Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt now believes that maps are becoming a “nice to have versus a need to have.” This conclusion gives some validity to Tesla’s approach, which has never relied on HD mapping. HD maps likely add additional complexity and costs, so Cruise’s migration away from this technique may be one of the reasons that it is able to expand into Austin and Phoenix, where it has no footprint, within the next 90 days.

 Given Cruise’s relatively cautious public relations strategy to date, its open commitment to two new cities is meaningful. Key to Cruise’s success will be its ability to scale its robotaxi service such that vehicle utilization rates increase, allowing for prices to fall significantly below those of human driven ride-hailing companies."

 Although the sample sizes were small, the sustained reduction in serum TTR, plasma kallikrein, and HAE attacks suggests that these one-time therapies could cure ATTR-CM and HAE patients.

 Ethereum Successfully Completed The Merge

Director of Research, Next Generation Internet

Early Thursday morning, developers and the community cheered as two pandas flashed on the screen, signifying the activation of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake chain. Livestreamed on YouTube (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74PqtB3pdrrV1-WJV7CgTr8W2mvkbK1YWxqrW1b27x17CBS28V1cGCK980Yy6W2p1t4D9gkR52W2Wqcqv7CWGdCVtM_gB3w4v6XW2CsKds6cSL8FW9kBZZj489qc6VtCKG69hBl_yN4j2jKXdp-pFW7y-rl26TgC5LW3pZhpy3Ml97PW4l1kqh4X3NqfW25F_dw89PgVwW1QhJM831kfZ0W5rdVVx5_QXssN77lWm57MTBZW7gsRsd8YDj3NW8s25Kf7l_0ZCW8ytkPZ7_kCVzW1qmTpX1M14dsW3gBG_16qBq0qW5mXLpg8Lc2mwW7Nlk_H91rZMg34K31 ) , the celebration erupted ~13 minutes later when validators justified the first transaction––including blocks of the new chain––and officially marked the Merge a success.

 Hotly debated since the network’s launch in 2015, the successful transition to Proof-of-Stake is a monumental accomplishment for Ethereum. Various community leaders from around the world joined the livestreamed event to reflect on years of valuable work and express excitement for the future. Top among the noted achievements were the elimination of Ethereum’s dependence on power-intensive GPUs and a reduction in ether’s inflation rate. Many of those celebrating acknowledged that the Merge is just the first step toward Ethereum’s scalability and usability.

 Community leaders also focused on Ethereum’s decentralization and the preservation of its censorship-resistance in its Proof-of-Stake form, an urgent issue after the Tornado Cash-related sanctions (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74PqtB3pdrrV1-WJV7CgX9CW5F9K597Vj0SHW3tkJBp2hswDMW1mJsBK40Bgl1W41Xh946RgB0DW4QC-tn5hsSnmW58H48L75kc_CW212bSG8lfdkxW4N3r5680j3M8V5GyLz209QJsW4f6VYy7Y5WyVW3K7v4f3YTtxGW5rXd308CR6tNW5hNH_q8XhSxbW80z6N52N4MjfW6BdcgY6hQV9YW6rCPbd2gXsbhW7KDg8M6gBWQMW8qBjD34c1Q-bW6PZhmz2dww77W3hTRSF6-hBL2W4QRLyv4PQ6f2W5g7QRB6sgXgmW8C0kmk8pm5mmW1DRj6Q2Zs-1s35rB1 ) in early August.

In our view, decentralization at the base layer is more important than the convenience and wider DeFi support that come with staking through the leading, more centralized providers.

 Concerns about network centralization took on more urgency on Thursday following SEC chairman Gary Gensler’s suggestion (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VVWtj137Q5dRW2Brgzc5sf3pnW8QwHkG4Q7jwBN74Pqvt3pdskV1-WJV7Cg-DBN5mV1lmQSdyHVDty-Q7cbSxHM_4wjqcP_6LW6qw_wN5ZzYfCW60_V8N3TQhh4W8Cb5nK8rqvNNW5B9TCV3LpbCNVHFpqV1-4lkCW5sFy_93JDYDJW4bMH2m5WCsdCW43Zm6v9h2XKBW920Rwz7M7mxKW2SgzYq73GFQ7W56S5X2956fYnW7tqyKs5c0cPVW68tx2S7KSYsFVs21-Y47WMvZW2xK27q1dXXMSW4mwPTd2gLQ0LVWxlmX32hPJpW7rjHx35l4Z1VW1nKHh152-YBBW75sXq381JWZGW3-4LSv4V2PBpW7Q_Sd91knc1DW9lYfVk1jJzRLW1mQrFd3n8DwRVRfDxF8KzJgRVnHbp83BbzGzVRr8bc8phRV732jY1 ) that Ethereum’s new mode––and entities like Coinbase who offer staking-as-a-service––are the equivalent of lending services subject to securities laws.

Good Afternoon,

Today, I decided to address one of America's most pressing financial burdens: our national debt. In 2022, we owe a collective $30 TRILLION, an incomprehensible amount of money. I spent the last week thinking about our national debt, and I have created 10 possible solutions that I wanted to share with you all.

Without further ado, here is an exhaustive list of the 10 best ways to solve the national debt crisis 🤝

10) Raise taxes and lower government expenses to run a budget surplus

What a boring, dumb, reckless idea! Why would the federal government, which controls the money supply, ever want to run a balanced book? The whole point of being the federal government is to not have to run a balanced budget.

 NEXT.

9) Keep interest rates low forever

This idea has accidentally sort of been happening already.

"
479_8,1656778520,news@execsum.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,10 Ways to Solve the National Debt Crisis,"Interest rates and inflation have an interesting relationship. Have you heard people saying that inflation is killing your savings account because the interest paid on savings accounts underperforms inflation? that same dynamic affects loans too.

Say that you secured a 4%, $500,000 mortgage to purchase your house last year when interest rates were low. Then inflation hits 8% YoY. Guess what? Your 4% payment on a $500,000 mortgage is now cheaper to service. The relative cost of those interest payments decreases as inflation increases, because the expense is a fixed amount of a depreciating currency.

 The higher the inflation, the less costly the loan over time.

"
479_9,1656778520,news@execsum.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,10 Ways to Solve the National Debt Crisis,"This applies to interest payments on our national debt too.

 If interest rates stay historically low and inflation stays elevated, our national debt becomes cheaper to service over time, just like a mortgage. Conspiracy theory: Is our current high inflation intentional?

8) Put the debt on the blockchain

*Two web3 crypto bros are sitting in a Silicon Valley apartment with no furniture except a couple of mattresses on the floor*

Brad: Bro, the national debt is getting pretty high.

 Chad: Bro, I think you are getting pretty high.

 Brad: True. But also, the national debt is getting pretty high.

*conveniently ignores the fact that every single crypto he is invested in is down 80% this year*

7) Transfer all of the debt to people in hospice care, Then let them die

For the Christians out there, you might be familiar with the idea of putting everyone's debts on one person, then killing him. I propose a similar framework for eliminating the national debt, except we will use several sacrificial lambs."

"
479_38,1656778520,news@execsum.co,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,10 Ways to Solve the National Debt Crisis,"You may have noticed that every single year, the US government has to vote to raise the debt ceiling. To put this in the simplest possible terms, this is because the US government spends more money than it generates in tax revenue. We could either A) run a balanced budget or B) raise our debt ceiling, so we typically go with B.

The trillion-dollar coin is a concept that emerged during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011, as a proposed way to bypass any necessity for the United States Congress to raise the country's borrowing limit, through the minting of very high-value platinum coins. This is only possible because of an interesting fluke in how the US Mint accounts for new currency issuances.  The issuance of paper currency is subject to various accounting and quantity restrictions that platinum coinage is not.

 According to 31 U.S.C. 5112(k) as originally enacted by Public Law 104-208 in 1996:

The Secretary may mint and issue bullion and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may prescribe from time to time.

 Platinum bullion coins can, by this statute, be minted in any denomination, whereas coins in any other specified metal are restricted to amounts of $50, $25, $10, $5 and $1.

First, we have discovered more oil and gas reserves, while energy prices are now much higher than they were a decade ago. Therefore, energy resources are more valuable now.

It would probably be a more legitimate investment than 99% of the companies that went public through SPACs over the last two years anyway.

 First, a brief description of a SPAC for the uninitiated:

SPACs offer a new method for companies to go public.

 Normally, private companies would hire banks to help them price their IPOs. These banks would drum up investor interest, and they would advise the companies on how much money to raise and at what price to issue new shares.

 Say the private company wants to raise $1B in new capital. When they ""go public,"" they could issue 10M new shares at $100 per share to raise $1B in new capital.

A BILLION IN THE METAVERSE
ZUCKERBERG'S BIG ASPIRATIONS FOR METAVERSE SPENDINGMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg told CNBC’s Jim Cramer on June 22nd that the metaverse could be a considerable part of the social network operator’s business in the second half of the decade. 
 “We hope to basically get to around a billion people in the metaverse doing hundreds of dollars of commerce, each buying digital goods, digital content, different things to express themselves, so whether that’s clothing for their avatar or different digital goods for their virtual home or things to decorate their virtual conference room, utilities to be able to be more productive in virtual and augmented reality and across the metaverse overall,” he said.
  Investors have cut the company’s market capitalization in half this year as growth has slowed and the number of its daily active users declined sequentially for the first time between the last two quarters.  
 Zuckerberg has been increasingly directing the company toward what he views as the next generation of content, a virtual world where people can buy and sell digital goods for avatars who can communicate with one another. The company’s ticker symbol changed from FB, a relic of its history as a pure social media provider, to META in early June.  But the company’s investment in augmented reality and virtual reality dates back to 2014, when it paid $2 billion for headset maker Oculus VR."

 Zuckerberg met with Cramer in the metaverse. The Facebook co-founder said such experiences can foster a sense of being together, even if people are physically on the other side of the country. He said it’s possible to make eye contact, which isn’t guaranteed on video calls, and use spatial audio that allow for quiet side conversations.

WhatsApp reached 2 billion users in 2020, and it’s also an area where Zuckerberg sees the potential for growth. 
 “You know, our playbook over time has been build services, try to serve as many people as possible — you know, get our services to a billion, two billion, three billion people, and then we basically scale the monetization after that,” Zuckerberg said."

SIX-TIME DISRUPTOR 50 COMPANY
Elon Musk's SpaceX ramped up a battle over broadband regulations with Dish Network and an affiliate of billionaire Michael Dell, calling for the FCC to address lingering disputes over broadband use that could interfere with its Starlink satellite internet network. At the heart of the dispute is use of the 12-gigahertz band, a range of frequency used for broadband communications, and the frequency’s ability to support both ground-based and space-based services.

The company has informed customers that they have until Aug. 15 to withdraw funds from online accounts and find new providers, Dubugras told CNBC. The move is the latest sign of a sea change occurring among start-ups as an abrupt shift in market conditions is forcing a new discipline on companies that previously focused purely on growth.

485_20,1656023287,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Zuckerberg's north star: a billion people in the metaverse,"With bricks-and-mortar locations closing or foot traffic lessoning, there were suddenly fewer ways to connect with consumers, causing companies to further accelerate that pivot to having digital engagement at the forefront of the business strategy.  That's a landscape that four-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company Twilio has been building towards. 
 Speaking to CNBC in 2014 when the company was named to the Disruptor 50 list for the second time, co-founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said Twilio was ""migrating a 150-year-old hardware industry to its future in software,"" likening what it was changing about how companies were communicating with their customers to what Amazon had done for technology infrastructure and Salesforce had done for CRM.
  Founded in 2008, the San Francisco-based company spent its early years convincing developers to use its application programming interface to add call, voice, text, and picture messaging to their apps, among other things. 
 Providing that level of communication enhancement gained early support from customers like Airbnb, Home Depot, Uber, and Walmart. It also helped Twilio raise nearly $240 million from investors like Bessemer Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures, resulting in a nearly $1 billion valuation by 2016. 
 The promise of digital customer engagement led to the company's IPO in June 2016, where its shares roared up 92% on its first day of trading.

THE FUTURE OF FINTECH GOP DRAFT BILL SEEKS TO TACKLE FINANCIAL DATA PRIVACY 
 A new draft bill from House Financial Services Ranking Member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., lays the groundwork for how the GOP will tackle financial data privacy if the party wins back the majority in the chamber this November. 
 The discussion draft, shared exclusively with CNBC, would modernize a financial data protection law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to cover data aggregators in addition to financial institutions and require more transparency with customers. Such changes could end up applying to fintech disruptors like Stripe, ranked No. 8 on this year's D50 list, or Plaid, ranked No. 47.
 
 The draft comes on the same day that lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, a new bipartisan framework that has launched digital privacy back into the limelight just as Congress prepares to wrap up for its August recess. While the push for a federal privacy law has had many stops and starts in the past, the new text provided a renewed spark behind the effort as it included compromises on key issues that had previously stalled talks.
  The draft aims to update a targeted part of the law and broaden it so it would remain relevant even in the face of further innovation, according to a senior Republican staffer for the Financial Services Committee not authorized to speak on the record. 
 “We didn’t want to start with a really prescriptive and restrictive model that’s going to prevent developers from building a new app or fine-tuning your app, creating new products,” the staffer said. “But we wanted to make sure that consumers had all of the information to make smart choices about what they are willing to share and what they are not willing to share.”  The discussion draft would require the financial institutions to tell customers when their nonpublic personal information is being collected, not just when it’s being disclosed to third parties. 
 It also would allow consumers to tell financial institutions and data aggregators to stop collecting their data or delete the data they have. In addition, it would expand the definition of personally identifiable nonpublic information subject to the law and companies covered by the bill would have to give consumers the ability to opt out of data collection if it isn’t necessary to provide service. 
 The draft bill allows for federal agencies to create rules that take into consideration the potentially higher burden of compliance on smaller firms. It would also preempt state law to create a national standard, something that some Democrats have rejected in other privacy discussions because they see the states as important places to expand protections on top of federal law.
  “This proposal will modernize the current framework to better align with evolving technology and protect against the misuse or overuse of consumers’ personal information,” McHenry said in a statement."
485_21,1656023287,disruptor50@cnbc.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Zuckerberg's north star: a billion people in the metaverse,"“I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this discussion draft to secure Americans’ privacy without strangling innovation.”

This Week: 8 mental models that will make you smarter
Jootsing
An extreme version of thinking outside the box that involves:
1) First gaining deep knowledge of the system and its rules
2) Then stepping outside to find something that subverts its rules
3) And finally, using your findings to make something new and creative

Worm's Eye View
Whether you’re a techie, politician, or corporate executive, you can’t fix a problem just by taking a top-down view. 
 You also need to look at the world bottom-up, through the workers’ eyes. 
 Be curious like a child and walk in others’ shoes.

The Easterlin Paradox
At a point in time happiness varies directly with income, but over time happiness doesn’t continue growing as income grows. 
 In other words, you think making more money will make you happier, but you’re wrong.
———
Hinge of History
We are part of a time in human history where we’ve never had such a disproportionate influence over our long-term futures. 
 The threats we face—climate, aging/declining population, space—and technology we build in the next 50 years are the future of humanity.
———
Legibility
Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. 
 We are blind to what we cannot measure. 
 We manage what we can measure, so society repeats the same mistakes.

Creativity Begins at the Edge of Reason
”Change starts away from the spotlight. 
 Then, it moves towards the center. 
 That’s why the most interesting ideas at a conference never come from the main stage. 
 They come from the hallways and the bar after sunset.”
 @scottbelsky ( https://twitter.com/scottbelsky )

Weasel Words
A type of word used when someone wants to make it seem like they’ve given a clear answer to a question when they’ve actually said something ambiguous or vague. 
 Weasel words:
· “Fairly”

· “Better”

· ”Probably”

· “Improved”

These words don’t say much.

Knightian Uncertainty
Risk applies to situations where we don’t know the outcome of a situation but can measure its probabilities. 
 Uncertainty applies to situations where we can’t even measure probabilities because quantifiable knowledge is unknowable.

These shoppers then go to the Shop app to redeem the cashback, and spend this money (and more) at Shopify brands. Shopify takes a cut of these transactions as the hosting platform. It’s a virtuous cycle.
 An added benefit: brands can “boost” the cashback offer within the Shop app to acquire new customers. Imagine you have $2 in cashback to spend on the app, and find a sweatshirt brand that’s offering to 10x this (a discount of $20 to you) on your first purchase. You’re much more likely to convert, and the brand gets a new customer. The $20 “CAC” is probably significantly lower than they’d pay to acquire you on a traditional digital channel like Facebook or Instagram.
 It’s a win-win-win for you, the brand, and Shopify."

 In 1980, a new political party, the Greens, was formed in Germany. Since the party's formation, the Greens have been concerned with the immediate halt of construction and operation of all nuclear power stations.  As an alternative, they have promoted a shift to non-nuclear renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power."

Fearing public backlash, politicians across all parties began to stress that nuclear was a “transient technology”, but not the future. After 1989, no new commercial nuclear power plants were built in Germany.

 Let's keep in mind that this anti-nuclear movement was supported by fear-mongering, not facts. Germany had the safest nuclear plants in the world. The Chernobyl disaster was caused by years of abhorrent misconduct across all levels of the chain of command."

 Germany decided to just ban the cars instead.

 This was quite beneficial for Schröder though, as the former Chancellor currently serves on Gazprom's (the owner of the Nord Stream pipeline) board, and he just recently stepped down from the board of Rosneft.

 I'm sure there were no conflicts of interest there, and Schröder just underestimated how long it would be before windmills could power Europe's biggest economy. Gas was just a ""transient"" fuel source, right?

20 years later, Germany is burning coal again as a result of its green movement. Very ESG."

, many pros want to do more than send their link... They want to
book meetings ""in their sleep. ""

My favorite way to do that is by embedding Calendly in a
website. In other words, put your availability right on your

then you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised with a meeting.

 says, ""The next decade is going to be defined by how we manage
our time â€” our most precious resource. The pandemic's impact on
an always-on workforce has caused many of us to rethink how we
allocate and optimize our time. It's been a wake-up call, and a
catalyst for change that's been a long time coming. ""

To learn more about the ""Time Economy,"" Calendly surveyed 1,000
knowledge workers across roles, industries, and company sizes to
discover how they value and use their time, as well as their
attitudes and frustrations regarding how their time is spent at
work.

 That number may be bad for the ol’ waistline, but it could be amazing for your portfolio, thanks to Piestro’s pizza automation ( http://url495.execsum.co/ss/c/QPgH8zGLXEhy0-wgSbIcTWlASmvHzfFJP3oHGotw-bUfzuy-2YQoOf5mpQXS5oT7DBXTH2aMUFzen5CHH3pVQ6VHHoP0TbCp_lPgyg7zXKL4ajQX-KcLDlGCrYiMrV50WF2sLVzs6cAjd9segeIDngvLDK83cUrjXfQsmNOpx03AnXflWzLHZ1_eUeMyauix/3n5/-Omu787nQiys1raWjTiLSw/t18/32xeI4_Kj4dkLccwXDqeszn76NL6LrDoG1-7tcKBpUU ). 

 Piestro can:

· Whip up an artisanal pizza in under 3 minutes ( http://url495.execsum.co/ss/c/QPgH8zGLXEhy0-wgSbIcTWlASmvHzfFJP3oHGotw-bUfzuy-2YQoOf5mpQXS5oT7DBXTH2aMUFzen5CHH3pVQ6VHHoP0TbCp_lPgyg7zXKL4ajQX-KcLDlGCrYiMrV50WF2sLVzs6cAjd9segeIDngvLDK83cUrjXfQsmNOpx03AnXflWzLHZ1_eUeMyauix/3n5/-Omu787nQiys1raWjTiLSw/t19/VmbAnOoGpA5HxHE9Nf69IPb1UrBnvC3IWFIXvgExvpg )

· Cook 24/7 (after all, robots don’t need bathroom breaks) 

· Triple the low profit margins (5-10%) and reduce the huge startup costs ($175K-$750K) of the restaurant industry


Piestro can’t: 

· Argue with you over whether pineapple belongs on your pie

· Shout “Mammi Mia, that’s a-spicy meatball!” 


 In terms of pros and cons, that might be the most lopsided list we’ve ever seen – all the more reason to head over to Piestro’s investment page and snatch up some shares before they’re all gone.

Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and Regeneron Phamaceuticals (REGN) made history at last year’s Peripheral Nerve Society Conference when they presented the world’s first data on CRISPR Cas9-based in-vivo gene editing therapy (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8jp5mNXrV3Zsc37CgVwwW49l-kg8grWv8W69_Vs53NP5kWW64M22J3TBhK7W5Z0M3n1rpRrTW5Jjskn1PxXRkW5PmQM08S_flBW73l1JY4kNB0DW19F-F84fTF0rW2ryJ_891VyS9W1MKYLM9h14lSW8w7HWM1FFhdTW1Dpldf6-LLSSN17MC1XrnZ0vVPC0DL3sjjPBW95dj3v3N4BpwW4s2YBQ8Yww_tW90tWd47TB8XGW111r422gsLH7W6dK9dp8mVSH8W5lJMGv8dS8qNW1DGN1B65H81CW5zwNyY78p1QxVtcw7Y72b24MW8lG4jk50hhCQV1tv4t89xt9QW7PNrMg2c0g24W1DkNQt1L-GDMW8z0L-R25rRW_W22pfgG3VdG40Vy3HSx8W7RMRW7McMfs4cQLysW1zd0jM5qgpVb3lrB1 ) in patients with Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis (hATTR) polyneuropathy1."

Notably, the researchers demonstrated that editing the TTR gene could deliver a one-time treatment that reduces sustained serum TTR, eliminating the need for chronic therapy."

Those patients showed sustained serum TTR reductions at all doses, with the first cohort reaching twelve months. Notably, at six months the mean TTR reduction for the highest dose cohort was still at 93% (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8jJ5mNXLV3Zsc37CgFhvW4h153V7r-7tlW6cg9V41vsyNGW7NJy076pvlDvW6cb8mW5zMHFTW2JMXCs2wZ3plW1MB0H212VlsqVrvYst7yhPcGW92WtJJ1vGtn7W1GXxBf7v7_DPW52kHnG6DNRpdW4pQ3C66lpw1LN8ZPMDmDm54NW4Gt9PL7zv1llW2QhZ5w4dr_CwW8lhppL8RfvbYW6Vh2Rl4cXWCqN4wZWy1W0js6W3zqcgW8ppq2rW9d7PsT8NMc7bW5SY8xS8b3nTXW2PhCpq6DfMz6W17KKtT10q3vvW2Fd24F6XcBKDW29RyLv5sHMkMW5SfHzb2YZ-pPW60Rjsx4gPpQsW8xk0YV7P4dtQW1RLp0L4f-9bKW7LHHZ621-VmRW4GBbjJ8mrW_-N7wVyZ5mmNfNW678nxD51HbZQW7wFscV8ZDCd0W2WcbJy45_2sJ3p981 ) .

 Although the sample size was small, sustained serum TTR reductions potentially indicate that this could be a one-time therapy to cure ATTRv-PN patients.

 While multi-signature wallets distribute across multiple parties the risk of private key compromises, the recent hacks illustrate that 2-of-5 and 5-of-9 schemes3 do not adequately protect the hundreds of millions of dollars bridged between public blockchains. Bridges like Ronin, in which one party controlled four of the nine keys, are particularly vulnerable.

 Nevertheless, the desire to move value across public blockchains remains astonishingly high."

This week, Cruise became the first self-driving ride-hail service to receive a permit to charge for fully autonomous rides in San Francisco. Majority-owned by General Motors, Cruise is undercutting Uber’s prices by about 15% (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8jp5mNXrV3Zsc37CgMMYW9k0-Jd3NhlYvW7zb2WQ360-76W4JBj548C243lW5Pq0_l82TSJtW2xHh8w7gMjMWW1RG11Z5YbM35W8P-Nrm99tS6NVg6Nn36YkK1RW4w-_Wc2YQ4F2W7DzJtL102tlxW8Gm1VW99yMDfW4b69VH6rsGBrW21wqKl3VFWQBW7xm7bq7ZGwXkVQWL3g4kyBDjW9fzrZW2RRFVBW1Z_rft4dL01wW6zJT0G1QjJ0dW5KPHYy4n-kN6VXPVCl2-mNMFW84stbK1vzZskW4rg4l_1Xmt1jW42mFl89hh5vTW1NyV3J86DkQZW7gPxZW7hlblWW23G9nZ5Pn66MW5HD4K66LFDx4W5G2lft86vwfZW1Hrkb06W-g2PVD0shj2fBSWBW1ZFM3N3yJfnCN7RvJJ8zZxZ23gJ41 ) , though its rides are limited to 30 miles per hour (mph) during the night from 10pm to 6am.

 ARK’s research (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8kB3pdrrV1-WJV7CgWV0W5RHPh09hNSK-N9l1CWKZF7FNW4SQ7jm2SXkbHW8dDlsR1cyLsNW2g8m9G8pJKP7F3PKRX2_ySkW5zt6yq6kG5vlW3XtJNC4jdMsvN1cKyNClw5NDN1pCC7w3cFg3W5BFL5B2l-nMnW4zVN7V5hqPFLW30jTVY6cRSJqVKfjv49fB6_RN5xdntvJQYHDW7PsKrz5x-KQrW92HVX340d2RDVY88CM2yWRVNMG-l-XHgyNHW69hb9985qwcPW3Bsl2W14Hn5zW1mN8463tl39mW4KLnym57QfQZW1rNbxS30LQTb3b-Y1 ) suggests that autonomous ride-hail services could operate at-scale profitably with prices as low as $0.25 per mile, a level that may not be necessary based on how consumers value their time. According to our research, price points in the $0.60-$1.00 per mile range should stimulate significant demand. At $6-7 per mile, Cruise’s prices are significantly higher, giving it the latitude to drive demand with lower prices.

 GM’s CEO, Mary Barra, has suggested that rides could cost less than $1 per mile (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8jJ5mNXLV3Zsc37CgRPsW5BCfWP6CsSWBW8CdyZ814pJ0cW7hl7Yv7V6LCrW81N1HN7CGx2JW9gxtsy8j9-mpW4RhhJZ7yZRK4W1Rl3qd3HZ4SnW8LDlZM7NXH-sW5XHJsr2cj0TNW1ZwnpM3LJJVjW1xFV7S3-Y2Z8W3xCf-L7TR3B5W8QQq9K4wTwgTW2y5gyh7zZ7X3W1cJCQ06ZBXzTW7Lv6cS580FwvW6N74NK4HRwhhW4nPZH-31pWKsW2zprRZ52ywnYW2VYP9B74cxFVW5fr9YT5ZyDBVW6P1ZBr2dsBRWW80mB_H2860RmW67jcqf8c0s2lW2WDNKQ4Dzy0FW5qQ3rK7Ts2WYW6njCQj5LBQMrN94R52W28W6-Vlb-9S2S2D65W7C6YpQ4P2rT6W7zdcnl3LmJZ9W40PRTk4TJx8zW4_trPW3NQv4DV-H6Ls1LWP4v39l11 ) in the long run, and former Cruise CEO, Dan Ammann, suggested the that its revenues could scale to $50 billion (https://research.ark-invest.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3nSf04/VWN_RQ3w7fBWW57j6n15sTXYvVpK0y34LQmJxM9V8jJ5mNXLV3Zsc37CgDrpW7Mg66f3GhGMCN8W1LcJ3BfylW9dg6SV3hWFCQW2d9d_c48qCCmW9cQbrt8qtfgyW6Rh5W87KqgbgVrZHrx8_WgN5W1_6j0J6Ht4GSW7rgmBS1q2JXwW6CHhjr8dz8RRW7yrpfX1M55y1N8KS1ch8F15QVxdSFh3yYS6LW2dSDHf3_63DgW62cSwR5Jwss3W7vYpFS2P1VW2W2zB_FC50pd8zW7xHSq554jXSQW5bY7VZ3WCCS8W8x8qjR6nTclJW41d0F62DJky-W6F1rcs2qKD0-W1w2R4F7J_TdKN97fdcvg4lpZW7jhD9S1r2gMPW7-5rxP2HSmFrVmxx972ttd7MW6Xs85s4kzGVCW20xkrS5ZK7hKW4BFV3J6V9jNVW51FmLn7PlZsqW6skHW77G-HLpW89F-KD1qgyhsW2NqQS82p8D573fxj1 ) by 2030."

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

eine kleine Erinnerungsreise: Als wir 2014 zum ersten Mal die ""Rockstars
Aftershow"" (wie sie damals noch hieÃŸ) am Abend des ersten Dmexco-Tages
veranstalteten, avancierten wir damit aus dem Stand zur Leitparty
(zwinker  zwinker
)
des Events. Wer sich mal mal anschauen will, wie unbeholfen und
unschuldig wir die Feier damals angekÃ¼ndigt haben, kann sich nochmal
den damaligen Artikel vom Kollegen Torben
,
inklusive der unpartyigsten Fotos ever, zu GemÃ¼te fÃ¼hren. 

Was dann Ã¼ber die Jahre hinweg daraus geworden ist, kÃ¶nnt Ihr dem
Recap-Film aus dem Jahr 2019

entnehmen, denn da fand die Aftershow aus bekannten GrÃ¼nden zum letzten
Mal statt."

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN

â“• Meta mÃ¼ht sich weiterhin damit, ""Commerce"" zu pushen

Meta investiert in ""Take App"" , ein von einem
ehemaligen Facebook-Manager gegrÃ¼ndetes Startup aus Singapur, wie
Techcrunch berichtet
.
 Take ermÃ¶glicht es, schnell und unkompliziert eine simple Website
einzurichten, die direkt an Whatsapp angebunden ist. Mit dem Messenger
sollen dann die Bestellungen verwaltet und getrackt werden kÃ¶nnen. Zu
den weiteren Investoren von Take gehÃ¶rt auch der bekannte Startup
Accelerator Y Combinator.

Was steckt dahinter? Schon seit Jahren versucht Meta, Whatsapp als
Verkaufs- und CRM-Plattform fÃ¼r Unternehmen zu etablieren, ohne
gleichzeitig die Endnutzer:innen mit einer zu aggressiven
Monetarisierung zu verschrecken. Im Mai veranstaltete das Unternehmen
unter dem Namen ""Conversations""  erstmals
ein eigenes Event zu diesem Thema. Dort stellte Meta u.a. eine neue, in
der Cloud gehostete Schnittstelle
sowie
kostenpflichtige Firmen-Accounts
mit
erweiterten Messaging-Funktionen vor. Doch so richtig hat der
""Conversational Commerce"" bisher noch nicht abgehoben.

 Warum nun das Investment? Mit einem Gesamtvolumen von einer Million
US-Dollar (es ist eine Seed-Runde) ist das Investment in Take App mit
Blick auf die GrÃ¶ÃŸe von Meta winzig. Trotzdem ist es auffÃ¤llig, dass
Meta selbst in einen solchen Dienstleister investiert, damit in
Konkurrenz zu Partner-Dienstleistern geht

und somit eventuell wichtige Vertriebspartner zu verÃ¤rgern droht
(Disclosure: OMR ist in den Whatsapp-Tool-Anbieter Charles
investiert). Die Vermutung liegt nahe,
dass Meta mehr Einblick in die Perspektive potenzieller Firmenkunden von
Whatsapp erhalten und herausfinden will, woran es hÃ¤ngt, dass die
Adaption so langsam vorankommt.

 The bigger picture: Meta hat erstmals mit sinkenden Werbeeinnahmen zu
kÃ¤mpfen; verursacht durch Apples Tracking-EinschrÃ¤nkungen und die
steigende Konkurrenz durch Tiktok. Wenig erstaunlich also, dass der
Konzern zum einen versucht, andere ErlÃ¶squellen zu erschlieÃŸen, zum
anderen aber auch wieder mehr Tracking-Daten zu erhalten (wenn Werbung
und Verkauf auf derselben Plattform stattfinden, ist das leichter
nachzuverfolgen). Gerade hat das Unternehmen eine zehnseitige Anleitung

fÃ¼r Firmen verÃ¶ffentlicht, wie sie besser Ã¼ber die vor zweieinhalb
Jahren eingefÃ¼hrten

Instagram Shops verkaufen. Ein weiterer Commerce-Versuch: In den USA
soll der Lieferdienst Doordash kÃ¼nftig auf dem Facebook Marketplace
verkaufte Artikel ausliefern
.

einem Blog-Artikel, wie diese Empfehlungen generiert werden -

we have this crazy notion that we have to be able to ""go it

 It's a bunch of hogwash.

 Here's the hard truth I had to tell myself not too long ago:

""Nick, your desire to be independent—a lone wolf—is harming
everything about your life: your relationships, your career, and
your love of learning new things."

The benefits of interdependance over independance have always
been true. But it's become even more true in the Information Age.
 If you are pridefully clinging to your independence, you are
asking to get left behind.

 Instead of getting left behind, how can we thrive?

How can we make our efforts a better, faster, and more joyful
experience?

This anniversary does, admittedly, land a bit differently in this particular moment; as our friends over at the New York Times point out, Title IX came of age around the same time as the Equal Rights Amendment was approved by the Senate and the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalized abortion at the federal level. Yet the ERA has still not been added to the Constitution, and the Supreme Court could soon decide (as early as today, when decisions start dropping at 10:00am ET) to overturn Roe. Thereâ€™s much about the fight for gender equality that now feels precarious, and not just for cis-gendered women; the rights of LGBTQ+ people are at stake, too. However, if you want to celebrate the Title IX anniversary, we recommend starting with a little story about the Mighty Macs. If youâ€™ve never heard of them, thatâ€™s okay; they hail from a small college in my home turf in the Philadelphia â€˜burbs, and were the first collegiate womenâ€™s basketball team to win a national championship. Thereâ€™s even a movie about them, but I recommend starting with this Forbes story about it all first."

 Good Morning,

The PGA Tour is tossing out suspensions left and right, Janet Yellen answers Cardi B's question about a possible recession (you read that right), Target bumped up its dividend, Manhattan rent is insane, Twitter is voting on Musk's takeover in August, and Citadel is boosting its in-person footprint in NYC.

 Looking forward to a sports heavy weekend with NBA finals, NHL conference finals, F1's Azerbaijan grand prix, LIV Golf and more.

See y'all tomorrow AM with the second edition of our Saturday opinion pieces by Jack Raines.

Liebe OMR-Leser*innen,

Philipp hat sie nach der Podcastaufzeichnung als ""vielleicht wichtigste
Person im europÃ¤ischen Digital-Business""

bezeichnet. Und ausnahmsweise geht es dabei nicht um eine
auÃŸergewÃ¶hnliche GrÃ¼ndung oder das nÃ¤chste groÃŸe Ding. Zu Gast war
Margrethe Vestager, EU-Kommissarin fÃ¼r Wettbewerb und damit wohl eine
der grÃ¶ÃŸten Kontrahentinnen der mÃ¤chtigen Tech-Plattformen.

 Mehr Relevanz fÃ¼r unser digitales Leben auch abseits aller
GeschÃ¤ftsmodelle in einer Person gebÃ¼ndelt, geht wohl kaum. Von daher:
ganz klare HÃ¶rempfehlung. 

 Torben

Seit acht Jahren kÃ¤mpft Margrethe Vestager als EU-Kommissarin gegen die
Ãœbermacht der Tech-Konzerne. Und obwohl diese so viel Geld in
Lobby-Arbeit stecken wie keine andere Branche, konnte sie in dieser Zeit
etliche Erfolge feiern. Was jetzt noch passieren muss, erklÃ¤rt sie im

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN

 Noch mehr Ads bei Twitch? Das sorgt bei Creator*innen und
Fans fÃ¼r Frust sorgt 

Gestern hat Twitch noch viel Zuspruch aus der Streaming-Community
erhalten. Die zu Amazon gehÃ¶rende Streaming-Plattform hatte
angekÃ¼ndigt, Werbung durch Streams fÃ¼r zahlreiche Casino-Seiten, unter
anderem das populÃ¤re Krypto-Casino Stake.com, verbieten zu wollen
.
 Schon einen Tag spÃ¤ter scheint die positive Stimmung wegen eines
anderen Themas schon wieder zu kippen. Denn jetzt hat Twitch
angekÃ¼ndigt, die Revenue Shares der Abo-Einnahmen anzupassen - und
darauf verwiesen, dass Streamer*innen eventuell anfallende Verluste mit
mehr Ads ausgleichen kÃ¶nnten
.

 Die Details: Dan Rancie, Twitch President, schreibt in einem Blogpost
Ã¼ber ein offenes Geheimnis der Plattform: spezielle Deals mit
grÃ¶ÃŸeren Streamer*innen, die statt wie der GroÃŸteil nicht nur 50
Prozent aller Abo-Einnahmen bekommen, sondern deutlich mehr."
572_3,1663852405,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Europas wichtigste Person im Digital-Business,"""This
isn't something we've talked about publicly, but such deals are
common knowledge within the streamer community"", so Rancie."
572_4,1663852405,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Europas wichtigste Person im Digital-Business,"Diese
Premium-Deals seien immer individuell gewesen und nicht transparent
kommuniziert worden. Und genau das soll sich jetzt Ã¤ndern."
572_5,1663852405,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Europas wichtigste Person im Digital-Business,"Ab Juni 2023 will Twitch das Revenue-Modell updaten. Bestehende
Premium-Deals sollen bestehen bleiben, eine zum Beispiel 70/30-Regel
aber nur fÃ¼r die ersten 100.000 US-Dollar Umsatz pro Jahr gelten. Ab
dann soll auch fÃ¼r diese meist sehr reichweitenstarken Streamer*innen
die 50/50-Regel gelten. 

Die Reaktionen: Dan Rancie betont in seinem Blog-Post, dass diese
Ã„nderung den GroÃŸteil der Streamer*innen nicht betreffen wÃ¼rde -
weil sie ohnehin den gÃ¤ngigen 50-prozentigen Revenue Share haben. Vor
allem die groÃŸen, reichweitenstarken Streamer*innen mit Premium-Deals,
die fÃ¼r die Plattform Twitch AushÃ¤ngeschild und Viewer-Magnet zugleich
sind, dÃ¼rften hingegen nicht allzu begeistert sein. 

 Erste Reaktionen haben entsprechend nicht lange auf sich warten lassen.
 Und vor allem Rancies Argument, die wegfallenden Einnahmen ab 100.000
US-Dollar Umsatz lieÃŸen sich mit Ads kompensieren, scheinen auf Unmut
zu stoÃŸen. Zack Breen aka ""Asmongold"", laut einer geleakten Liste der
bestverdienenden Twitch-Streamer mit 2,5 Millionen US-Dollar auf Platz
14 , positioniert
sich auf Twitter gegen Ads. Sie wÃ¼rden Twitch zerstÃ¶ren. Seinem
Aufruf, den Tweet zu liken, wenn man je einen Stream wegen zu vieler Ads
abgebrochen habe, folgten bisher Ã¼ber 150.000 User
.

 Wie geht es weiter? Schon lÃ¤nger tobt ein Kampf um die besten
Creator*innen zwischen Twitch und Googles Pendant Youtube Gaming. In der
Vergangenheit haben sich immer wieder prominente Streamer*innen von
Twitch verabschiedet, vermutlich weil sie bei Youtube vermutlich mehr
verdienen. Zuletzt unterschrieb die Streamerin Fuslie einen
Exklusiv-Vertrag bei Youtube Gaming
.
 Mit den jÃ¼ngsten Entwicklungen auf Amazons Streaming-Plattformen wÃ¤ren
weitere prominenten AbgÃ¤nge wenig Ã¼berraschend.

  Newsbites: Julian Hosp, Tarek MÃ¼ller, Klarna

Dubiose Fintech-Startups: Dr. Julian Hosp, Mediziner, ehemaliger
Profi-Kitesurfer und GrÃ¼nder mehrerer Krypto-Projekte wie Tenx und Cake
Defi, steht seit langem in der Kritik. Weil er aber in Singapur lebt und
arbeitet, fÃ¤llt es der deutschen Finanzaufsicht Bafin offenbar schwer,
aktiv zu werden. Der ehemalige Bundestagsabgeordnete Fabio De Masi
erklÃ¤rt am Beispiel Hosp fÃ¼r Finance Forward die Regulierungs-Probleme
der Krypto-Welt .

 Think with Tarek: RegelmÃ¤ÃŸig tauscht sich Rolf Hermann, Head of OMR
Education und Chefredakteur der OMR Reports, mit About-You-GrÃ¼nder
Tarek MÃ¼ller im Podcast ""Think with Tarek"" aus. In der aktuellen Folge
geht es um Counterstrike, Nacktheit, Geld, ICQ und Business. Laut Rolf
""die persÃ¶nlichste Episode bisher"". Hier reinhÃ¶ren

schwedischen Tageszeitung SVD soll nun die nÃ¤chste Entlassungswelle
laufen. Klarna selbst spricht von einer Umstrukturierung

The Cobra Effect
“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” — Charlie Munger
Well-designed incentives have the power to create great outcomes; poorly-designed incentives have the power to…well…create terrible outcomes.
 Goodhart’s Law says that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Simply put, if a measure of performance becomes a stated goal, humans tend to optimize for it, regardless of any associated consequences. The measure often loses its value as a measure.
 One of the most prominent examples of this in action comes from the story of the British colonists’ cobra eradication efforts in India.
 There were too many cobras in India."

 Some savvy locals developed a business model:
Breed cobras
Chop of their heads
Turn in cobra heads and collect bounties
The British realized what was happening and ended the policy. Many of the breeders simply released their remaining cobras onto the streets, thereby increasing the population of cobras.
 The British viewed cobra heads as a simple measure cobra elimination, so attached an incentive to deliver cobra heads. The result? An incentive designed to reduce the cobra population actually increased it.

 Interestingly, the seeds of the bull market are often planted at the beginning of Stage 3 and begin to take form during that period.
 My perspective is simple: If you can be a buyer when everyone else is a forced seller, you are positioning yourself well for long-term growth and success. Being a buyer can take any number of forms—it can relate to accumulating talent, building new ideas, or creating new opportunities.
 During periods of prolonged darkness, this is the playbook:

 Get Good at Sales: I’ve always said that you can get really far in life by just being likable and having the ability to sell. You have to learn to sell—whether you’re fundraising, recruiting talent, trying to land a new job, whatever. If you can sell, you’ll always make it.

Why You’re Smarter Than You Think
Phenomenal episode of the Hidden Brain podcast that questions the foundations of our thinking on childhood intelligence.
 I have always found it crazy that we start assessing and ranking children based on standardized measures of intelligence at such a young age.

 Hi there,



This is a reminder that Hotjar’s updated pricing model 
 will take effect for 
all existing accounts from July 1.

don’t need to do anything and you won’t pay more in the updated pricing model.

 

 What’s happening?

across Feedback and Surveys on all Hotjar plans. 
 * From July 1, all Hotjar accounts (with the exception of those with annual 
subscriptions - see below) will have separate plans forObserve (Heatmaps & 
Recordings) andAsk (Surveys & Feedback). 
 * If you don’t choose an Ask plan for your site by July 1, your site will 
default to the Ask Basic (free) plan."

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

ich habe 2016 das erste Mal von Pamela Reif gehÃ¶rt und direkt einen
Artikel Ã¼ber die Influencerin geschrieben. Sie hatte schon damals zwei
Millionen Follower auf Instagram - eine krasse Zahl in Deutschland
damals. Sie kam dann zum OMR Festival 2016 und zu unserer kleinen
NPA-Konferenz. Und dann legte sie so richtig los. Heute ist Pamela nicht
nur eine der reichweitenstÃ¤rksten deutschen Influencerinnen, sie baut
derzeit auch ein Millionen-Business auf. Mehr dazu hÃ¶rt Ihr im Podcast

 Pamela Reif im OMR Podcast: So baut die Influencer-Queen an ihrem
Business-Imperium

Auf Instagram und Youtube hat Pamela Reif in Summe Ã¼ber 17 Millionen
Follower. Hinzu kommen 37 Millionen Fans auf chinesischen Plattformen.
 Die 25-jÃ¤hrige Karlsruherin gilt als die deutsche Influencer-Queen.
 Aber Pamela Reif hÃ¤lt nicht einfach Produkte in die Kamera. Sie hat ein
eigenes Food-Unternehmen mit Millionen-UmsÃ¤tzen, langfristige VertrÃ¤ge
 mit groÃŸen Partnern und eine App, die millionenfach heruntergeladen
wurde. Im OMR Podcast erzÃ¤hlt sie, wie sie das alles vor allem mit
ihrer Familie umsetzt und wie ihre Strategie genau funktioniert.

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN  

 Amazon-Marken-AufkÃ¤ufer in Not

Noch vor Kurzem bejubelt, jetzt am Boden. So geht es derzeit vielen
Tech-Unternehmen. Besonders hart trifft es anscheinend die sogenannten
Amazon-Aggregatoren. Unternehmen wie Thrasio
, Berlin Brands Group
oder
 SellerX 
kaufen mit Millionen bewaffnet kleine Amazon-Marken und wollen so zu
Handelsriesen aufsteigen - zu den Unilevers und Procter & Gambles der
Amazon-Welt. Doch durch den Wachstums-Einbruch im E-Commerce wackelt das
GeschÃ¤ftsmodell jetzt bedrohlich. 

Was ist da los? GegenÃ¼ber dem Handelsblatt

spricht Berlin-Brands-Group-GrÃ¼nder Peter Chaljawski (war auch auf der
OMR22-BÃ¼hne) Ã¼ber die derzeitig schwierige Lage: ""Wir erleben eine
tiefe ZÃ¤sur im Markt. Das GeschÃ¤ftsmodell der Branche war bisher oft
ausschlieÃŸlich darauf ausgerichtet, dass die Ã¼bernommenen Marken
stetig weiterwachsen."" Wegen gestiegener Kosten, viel Wettbewerb und
trÃ¼ben GeschÃ¤ftsaussichten kÃ¶nnten die Aggregatoren ihre Versprechen
gegenÃ¼ber Investoren aber nicht mehr halten. 

15 Milliarden Euro waren von Fonds und Private-Equity-HÃ¤usern in den
vergangenen Jahren in unzÃ¤hlige Amazon-AufkÃ¤ufer geflossen. Ohne
Wachstumsversprechen dÃ¼rfte diese Geldquelle versiegen, die so wichtig
fÃ¼r das GeschÃ¤ftsmodell ist. ""Wir hatten ursprÃ¼nglich fÃ¼r dieses
Jahr mit einem starken Wachstum kalkuliert und sehen stattdessen eine
SeitwÃ¤rtsbewegung"", so Chaljawski gegenÃ¼ber dem Handelsblatt. 

 Und warum ist das wichtig? Die Berlin Brands Group zieht jetzt die
ReiÃŸleine und entlÃ¤sst fast 100 Mitarbeitende - etwa zehn Prozent
der Belegschaft. ""Das ist die schwierigste Entscheidung in meinen 17
Jahren als Unternehmer"", sagt der GrÃ¼nder. Die dramatische Entwicklung
steht symbolisch fÃ¼r die trÃ¼ben"
581_3,1654769675,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Die deutsche Influencer-Queen,"Aussichten im E-Commerce. Wie die
Berlin Brands Group versucht die gesamte Branche derzeit Kosten zu
senken. Der Boom der Corona-Jahre hat offenbar nicht zu dem
langfristigen Effekt gefÃ¼hrt, den sich E-Commerce-Unternehmen erhofft
hatten."

Das OMR Festival 2022 ist jetzt eine Woche her, und viele haben Quentin,
Ashton und viele andere im Kopf. Zentral waren aber auch die groÃŸen
Themen digitale Transformation, neues Kaufverhalten und das Rennen um
Reichweiten und Aufmerksamkeit.

 **Wer da fÃ¼hrend ist:* * Eine Hauptrolle spielte dabei Google. Das
Unternehmen will gemeinsam mit Euch digitale Chancen weiterdenken. Auf
unseren OMR-BÃ¼hnen hatten Speakerinnen und Speaker von Google vor allem
 Learnings zu YouTube, Search und E-Commerce dabei.

 **Was das Euch bringt:** Ihr kÃ¶nnt jetzt die Auftritte von z.B.
YouTube-Europachef Pedro Pina von der Conference Stage und alle
Google-Masterclasses in voller LÃ¤nge anschauen. Mehr Infos dazu und

 Newsbites: 

* *NFT-Hype, Spotify, Apple**

**NFT-Hype vorbei:** Techcrunch analysiert, dass NFT-VerkÃ¤ufe um 70
Prozent eingebrochen sind
. Die
wirtschaftliche Lage macht auch vor digitalen GÃ¼tern nicht Halt.
Expert:innen sprechen schon vom NFT-Winter - denn viele der
""Kunstwerke"" verlieren aktuell auch stark an Wert.

 **Spotifys Podcast-Business:** Der Streaming-Service verÃ¶ffentlicht
erstmals Zahlen Ã¼ber seine Podcast-Einheit
.
 Kurz zusammengefasst: 200 Millionen Euro Umsatz (Wachstum von 300
Prozent), Ã¼ber 125 monatliche HÃ¶rer:innen und trotzdem einen negativen
BruttoerlÃ¶s von minus 57 Prozent. Nur 14 Prozent der HÃ¶rdauer von
Podcasts sei bisher auf der Plattform monetarisiert.

 Apple wird zur Bank: Der iPhone-Konzern hat gerade ein eigenes ""Buy Now,
 Pay Later""-Modell vorgestellt und tritt damit in Konkurrenz zu Klarna
und Paypal. Wie jetzt bekannt wird, hat Apple dafÃ¼r die Apple Financing
LLC gegrÃ¼ndet
.
 Eine eigenes Unternehmen, dass Ã¼ber die Kreditvergabe wacht. Apple
betreibt jetzt also auch eine eigene Bank.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

gestern, Rückreise vom Youtube Festival in Berlin (dazu später mehr
auf omr.com), ICE (verspätet): Eine Zugbegleiterin mit engelsgleicher
Stimme macht mir die Ansage der Zwischenhalte (Wittenberge, Ludwigslust)
zum reinen Vergnügen. Dann das besondere Highlight: Weil der Zug auf
der Fahrt natürlich noch mehr Verspätung drauflegt, wird es für viele
Weiterreisende ab Hamburg Hauptbahnhof sehr knapp. Also ruft sie
glückselig ins Mikro: ""Die Bahn nach Kopenhagen wird tatsächlich auf
uns warten. Ich wiederhole: Sie erreichen wirklich den Anschlusszug nach
Kopenhagen."" Kleines Wunder also 23:35 Uhr kurz vor dem Bahnhof. 

 Jetzt noch der Schlenker zum Artikel des Tages: Hoffentlich setzt Mario
Kohle Technologie auch so gewinnbringend ein, wie die Schaffnerin ihr
Mikrofon. Mehr dazu im Podcast.

 Ich liebe Züge 
Martin

Enpal-Gründer Mario Kohle will Solaranlagen auf jedes Hausdach bringen

Der Einbau von Solaranlagen ist teuer, weshalb viele Hausbesitzer darauf
bislang verzichtet haben. Dabei wäre der Ausbau der Solarenergie
sinnvoll - allein schon wegen steigender Energiepreise. Mit seinem
Startup Enpal bietet Mario Kohle Solaranlagen zur Miete an. Anfangs fiel
es ihm schwer, mit dieser Idee Investoren zu überzeugen. Doch dann hat
sich plötzlich alles verändert.

 Der Absturz von der Social Chain Group?

 Das Manager Magazin berichtet aktuell

von Chaos in der Social-Chain-Gruppe von Georg Kofler und Ralf Dümmel.
 Im Oktober 2021 hatte Koflers Social Chain die Dümmel-Firma DS Gruppe
noch für über 220 Millionen Euro übernommen. Heute sei die gesamte
Social-Chain-Gruppe nur noch 150 Millionen Euro wert. 

Was ist da los? Eigentlich war die Übernahme zu Beginn ein voller
Erfolg. Mitte November 2021 erreichte der Börsenwert von Social Chain
fast 680 Millionen Euro. Eine Kapitalerhöhung bringt kurze Zeit später
53,1 Millionen Euro
.
 Seitdem türmen sich laut dem Manager Magazin die operativen Verluste
( minus 24,7 Mio. Euro in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2022). Der Börsenkurs
ist seit dem Hoch um 80 Prozent eingebrochen, es herrsche Desillusion
und Chaos. Mehrere Manager:innen stehen demnach vor dem Absprung.

 Wie konnte das passieren? Im Unternehmen haben offenbar Vertraute von
Ralf Dümmel übernommen. Der wichtigste Grund für den Abstieg scheint
aber ein durch Corona-Deals aufgeblasener Umsatz im Jahr 2021 zu sein.
 Die Führung der Social Chain räumte im Frühjahr ein, dass der Verkauf
von Masken, Desinfektionsmitteln und Covid-Tests 116 Millionen Euro
Umsatz einbrachten - und die fallen jetzt weg. Kritik wird laut, weil
Kofler und Dümmel diese Abhängigkeit (ein Fünftel der Jahresumsätze
durch Corona-Produkte) beim Aufstieg in den regulierten Börsenhandel
nicht kommuniziert hatten. 

 Und was die Vision der Social Chain angeht, Marken über
Social-Plattformen groß zu machen und dann Produkte direkt über den
Online-Shop zu verkaufen: Ein Insider schätzt im Manager Magazin, dass
der Großteil des Umsatzes im stationären Geschäft - vor allem bei
Discountern - gemacht wird."

Lange Zeit galten Homepage-Baukästen als schnelle Lösung. Mittlerweile
bieten sie alle Funktionalitäten, die früher nur teure Programmierer
liefern konnten. Weltmarktführer Wix zählt heute 200 Millionen
Nutzer:innen und stellt rund 800 Templates mit Tausenden integrierten
Tools für professionelle Portfolio-Webseiten, Shops und Blogs zur
Verfügung - im Basisprogramm alles kostenlos, SEO und Webhosting
inklusive. 

 Das Beispiel von Gründer Nico Langner zeigt
, was Wix auch
für Agenturen leisten kann. Als Partner der Plattform konnte der
Einzelunternehmer seinen Kundenstamm innerhalb eines halben Jahres mehr
als verdoppeln. Hier lest Ihr die ganze Story.

‍ Newsbites: Facelift, Tiktok, NFT-Betrug

Facelift kauft ein: Das Social-Media-Management-Tool Facelift aus
Hamburg kauft den Kölner Analytics-Anbieter Quintly
.
 Das Team werde übernommen und das Quintly-Produkt bleibe einzeln
verfügbar - soll aber auch in die Facelift-Suite integriert werden.

 In der Nähe: Tiktok testet derzeit offenbar einen ""Nearby""-Feed
- neben
der For You Page und dem Feed aus Kanälen, denen Nutzer:innen bereits
folgen. In dem Feed wird Content von Menschen und Unternehmen aus Eurer
Nähe angezeigt. Das könnte besonders für Restaurants & Co. spannend
werden, die lokal Kund:innen erreichen wollen.

 NFT-Betrug in Rekordzeit: Die NFT-Plattform Sudorare hat sich nach nur
sechs Stunden als Betrug entpuppt
. Nach
dieser kurzen Zeit verschwanden die Betreiber:innen mit über 800.000
Euro.

One Framework:
The 4 Types of Luck
Luck is a fascinating topic—often discussed, but rarely deconstructed. One of the best frameworks I’ve encountered to deconstruct luck is from Naval Ravikant [ https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUMGuhCAM_JrlaAAB9cDhXd5vmIpVySIYqLvx7x8-k6Zp0047Mw4I15Qve6RC7E4jXQfaiN8SkAgzOwvm0c9W8XZQQihWy1n0ume-jEtG3MEHS_lEdpxT8A7Ip3gjjJFKsc3qwfUaNJcCjAMpdMe50-3SdrwFg-75C-fsMTq0-MF8pYjMpX3HSPcpFuxGdJRX-_OSvzXo6292Td2pXYQPBOat5FJyI7iQnEvTtE03K24WXYnohasBXorvq2zKORUC977hLFvyezP5_N7Sgrmu1FmmNaQJQpPyeusabzJn9HSNGGEKOD-S6XHu34RxxYi5OjqPQFYYrXojtdKm6x6JVYjuDdedMqxSmFNFRVtg82EKKe1_gGWGJA ].

Type I—Blind Luck: Completely uncontrollable."

 Type II—Hustle Luck: You’re creating motion and collisions through hustle and energy that you are inserting into an ecosystem."
593_10,1654862426,sahilbloom@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,"The Greatest Life Hacks, Types of Luck, & More","The increase in collisions opens you up to more lucky events.
 Type III—Awareness Luck: Depth of understanding within a given arena allows you to become very good at identifying and positioning yourself for luck. You can “spot luck” from a mile away because of your sensitivity to it.
 Type IV—Expert Luck: Your expertise in a given arena creates luck. If you are an expert in a field, luck actually seeks you out.
 I personally think of Type I - III as coming in stages as you grow up:
Type I dictates the early years of your life.
 Type II comes into play as you begin to hustle in your 20s.
 Type III sets in as you develop experience and awareness in your 30s.
 Type IV is unique—it’s dislocated from age dependency.
 In the digital age, expertise is no longer closely guarded by credentials or gatekeepers. Instead, it’s earned in the global intellectual arena of the internet."

Unpacking Carta's Startup Compensation Report
Carta's H1 2022 State of Startup Compensation report ( http://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/VX5Jeg2DMgI1k0SStgCs-9WD7pr9Pw6b1z2oYTLcw_WNmHEEP0gOWrnqFW5EIkQ3Uf_zMZWCU-M_Ks58pUrpCQ/3o2/ziDdodP4QZOBKAvS-j_eQQ/t2/CCi9ntWHffZ18QN76d4QTXTKh0qS0KShQwF-M1s0b6o ) published a few weeks ago (includes 127k employee records from across Carta's platform) paints an interesting narrative on how startup hiring is evolving.
 First, startups continued hiring more out-of-state than in-state across nearly all valuation bands."
625_4,1658844285,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Unpacking Carta's Startup Compensation Report,"In H1 2022, 62% of new hires were in a different state than their employers primary HQ, compared to 55%, 43%, and 35% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively."
625_5,1658844285,thesplit@mail.beehiiv.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Unpacking Carta's Startup Compensation Report,"While this may indicate an increase in multi-state offices, the most likely interpretation is a continued increase in remote hiring. Notably, remote hires decreased at companies valued below $10 million - the only valuation band to do so.

Average compensation across the US continues converging with San Francisco. 84% of companies are now geo-adjusting compensation, with Miami giving significantly more adjustments beyond the BLS Cost of Living compared to SF (+22% more) than others like Phoenix (+1%), Philadelphia (+2%), and San Antonio (+2%).

Median startup salaries generally peak around a $500 million valuation. As a startup employee, the sweet spot in terms of salary + equity upside may be around the $50 to $500 million valuation range generally set between Series A and C. Just make sure your options are based on a realistic valuation, especially if set in 2021...

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

dass ich es erst heute morgen mitbekommen habe, spricht Bände: Der
Internet Explorer ist Geschichte. Mutterkonzern Microsoft hat unter der
Woche den Support endgültig eingestellt; nach und nach soll der Browser
inklusive Icons komplett verschwinden und dem inzwischen auch schon
sieben Jahre alten Nachfolger Edge weichen."

das Internet abgestellt. Eine Ära endet trotzdem; immerhin war der IE
für viele das erste Eingangstor ins Internet. Mit zuletzt weniger als
einem Prozent Marktanteil werden wir vermutlich dennoch darüber
hinwegkommen. Edge kommt übrigens auf knappe zehn Prozent, bis zum
nächsten Abschied haben wir also noch ein paar Jahre."

Bereitstellung von Tools und Daten auf die eigene Plattform zu locken.
 Besonders umfangreich ist das ""Creative Center"". Wir haben uns darin
u.a. angesehen, welche Ads für welche Produkte bei Tiktok aktuell
offenbar besonders gut performen
- und was das
über die Plattform aussagt.

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN

 Er kauft Twitter, er kauft Twitter nicht, er kauft Twitter,
er kauft...

 Als Tesla- und SpaceX-Chef Elon Musk Mitte April zum ersten Mal klar
formulierte, den Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter kaufen zu wollen, nachdem
er seine Anteile bereits auf neun Prozent erhöht hatte, überschlugen
sich die Reaktionen - nicht nur auf der Plattform selber. 41
Milliarden US-Dollar wäre ihm die Übernahme wert
. Rund vier
Wochen später wollte der laut Forbes reichste Mensch der Welt dann vom
Deal zurücktreten, weil Twitter ein Problem mit Fake-Accounts habe.
 Anfang Juni folgte ein Schreiben seiner Anwälte an Twitter mit
ähnlichem Inhalt. Nach einem zwischenzeitlichen"
626_3,1655464273,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Tiktoks interner Datenschatz,"Hoch ist Twitter an der
Börse derzeit ""nur"" noch rund 29 Milliarden US-Dollar wert."
626_4,1655464273,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Tiktoks interner Datenschatz,"All Hands Meeting mit Twitter: Mitten in dieser vermutlich nicht nur
für Außenstehende teilweise unübersichtlichen Gemengelage fand jetzt
ein großes All Hands Meeting statt - mit Elon Musk. Richtig gelesen.
 Der Mann, der erst verkündete, ein Unternehmen kaufen zu wollen, mit
öffentlicher Kritik dann zumindest einen wesentlichen Beitrag dazu
leistete, den Kurs und damit den Wert eben dieses Unternehmens nach
unten zu korrigieren, plauderte knapp 50 Minuten lang vor rund 8.000
Mitarbeitenden mit der Twitter-CMO Leslie Berland. Das Meeting war
ursprünglich zwar schon für April angesetzt, nachdem Musk über 70
Millionen Twitter-Shares gekauft hatte. Das jetzige Treffen, während
die Verhandlungen um die finale Übernahme noch laufen, mutet dennoch
etwas seltsam an. 

 Darum ging es: Die New York Times beschreibt das Gespräch, das Elon
Musk offenbar in einem Hotelzimmer per Smartphone führte, als
""überschwänglich und manchmal ausschweifend""
.
 Musk habe über verschiedenste Themen gesprochen, vom Wachstum der
Plattform über mögliche Entlassungen bis zu Außerirdischen. Schnell
wurde ein Mitschnitt des Gesprächs
veröffentlicht;  ein
komplettes Transkript des Meetings

gibt es mittlerweile ebenfalls. Hier einige der spannendsten Aussagen:

* Stellenabbau: Twitter mache aktuell Verluste, was nicht ""nicht toll""
sei und es müsste gewisse Rationalisierungen geben. Wer einen
""wesentlichen Beitrag"" leistet, habe aber nichts zu befürchten 

* Geschäftsmodell:"
626_5,1655464273,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Tiktoks interner Datenschatz,"Twitters Umsatz müsse sich aus Subscribtions und
Advertising zusammensetzen, auch Payments könnten interessant sein.
 Bots und Fake-Accounts seien die größte Herausforderung

* Wachstum: Elon Musk will eine Milliarde oder mehr Daily Active User
für Twitter, aktuell seien es 200"
626_6,1655464273,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Tiktoks interner Datenschatz,"Millionen 

*"
626_7,1655464273,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Tiktoks interner Datenschatz,"Free Speech: Musk wolle freie Meinungsäußerung, so weit es
rechtliche Rahmen ermöglichen, zulassen. Er wolle vor allem, dass
Twitter-User sich unterhalten und informiert fühlen - und lobt die
User Experience bei Tiktok, die dafür sorge, dass man sich nicht
gelangweilt fühle.

* Übernahme: Echte Neuigkeiten zu Musks Kaufofferte gab es nicht
wirklich. Wenn aber nicht schon das Stattfinden des Gespräches selber
ein Zeichen dafür ist, dass der Deal näher rückt, könnte es eine
Formulierung in einer Frage von CMO Leslie Berland sein: ""

**Connected to that you're obviously learning things as we get closer to
this deal closing...""**

Es bleibt also weiter spanned, ob, wann und wie der Deal über die
Bühne geht. Parallel sieht sich Musk übrigens mit einer
258-Milliarden-US-Dollar-Klage

konfrontiert: Er hätte den Dogecoin-Kurs manipuliert und bei Anlegern
für massive Verluste gesorgt. Die Elon-Musk-Show geht weiter.

  Newsbites: Tiktok Shop

**, Klarna & Snapchat**

Live-Shopping hebt nicht ab: Im vergangenen Jahr hat Tiktok in
Großbritannien als einzigem Markt außerhalb Asiens ""Tiktok Shop""
gelauncht. Das Live-Shopping-Feature scheint bei Creator:innen nicht
sonderlich gut anzukommen, Influencer:innen kehren dem Projekt jetzt den
Rücken (Financial Times, Paywall)
.

 Unklare Zukunft für Klarna? Der Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Riese aus Schweden
wurde im vergangenen Jahr noch mit 45 Milliarden US-Dollar bewertet.
 Jetzt soll das Unternehmen auf der Suche nach frischem Geld sein, bei
einer Bewertung von nur noch 15 Milliarden US-Dollar (Wall Street
Journal, Paywall)
.

 Snap - Subscription Power: Snap befindet sich aktuell in einer
internen Testphase für ein kostenpflichtiges Abo-Modell. ""Snapchat
Plus"", wie das Feature heißt"", soll der App dabei helfen,
wiederkehrende Umsätze zu generieren. Das Werbegeschäft ist
spätestens seit iOS14.5 kein zuverlässiges Business Model mehr (The
Verge)
.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

vor kurzem erhielt ich 15 Anrufe an einem Tag: Eine Computerstimme sagte
mir, Europol würde mich darüber informieren, dass meine persönlichen
Daten unrechtmäßig verwendet werden würden - und bittet mich um
einen Abgleich derselben. Wem das kürzlich genauso ging, sei hiermit
gewarnt. Das ist eine Betrugsmasche,

die bei Kriminellen scheinbar gerade populär ist. 

Was ich mich seitdem frage: Wer war das wohl, der sich mit meinen Daten
einen Reibach gemacht und sie an irgendwelche Gangster verkauft hat?
 Natürlich fallen mir da einige Kandidaten ein. In meinem Fall wird es
vermutlich irgendeine dieser Kryptoseiten sein, für die ich mich im
Zuge meiner Recherchen im vergangenen Jahr registrieren musste. Bei den
aktuellen Kursen wundert micht nicht, dass der ein oder andere
Seitenbetreiber das nötig hat. 

 Ich bin nicht jähzornig, aber ganz ehrlich: Ich hoffe, solchen Menschen
rutschen bis zu Ihrem Lebensende beim Händewaschen die Ärmel runter.
 Und mit allen anderen, denen es so geht wie mir, kann ich nur einen
Gedanken teilen, der mir immer wieder Trost spendet:

Karma regelt."

 Zalando übernimmt die Mehrheit an Highsnobiety

Europas größter Modehändler Zalando übernimmt die Mehrheit an High
Snobiety
,
dem von David Fischer 2005 gegründeten Fashion-Magazin. Welchen Anteil
und zu welchem Preis Zalando diesen erworben hat, ist nicht bekannt.
 Zalando setzt damit zum Angriff gegen Konkurrent About You, der vor
allem bei der jüngeren Zielgruppe beliebt ist. 

 Zum Hintergrund: High Snobiety (hier die Keynote des Gründers auf dem
OMR Festival 2022)   war
ursprünglich als Lifestyle- und Streetwearmagazin in Berlin gestartet,
wurde aber mit eigenen Kollektionen schnell selbst zum Retailer von
High-End-Fashion. Daneben hat sich vor allem die Content Marketing
Abteilung von High Snobiety verdient gemacht. Das Ensemble aus
Storytelling, Drop-Verkäufen und Kollabos mit Influencern und Marken
machten das Magazin zu einem Vorreiter der Creator Economy. Das
spiegelte sich zuletzt auch in den Zahlen wieder: 2021 hat High Snobiety
über 50 Millionen Euro Umsatz erwirtschaftet, über die Website und
Social Media erreicht das Unternehmen mehr als 35 Millionen Menschen"
627_2,1655213044,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Diese Tiktok-Creator sind krass,"im
Monat. 

 The bigger picture: Das börsennotierte Zalando hatte zwar wie alle
E-Commerce-Unternehmen im Zuge der Pandemie Aufwind genossen, allein im
vergangenen Jahr aber sank der Wert der Aktie um ein Drittel (€)
.
 Und der Hamburger Konkurrent About You hat Zalando in den vergangenen
Jahren die junge Zielgruppe offenbar ziemlich erfolgreich streitig
gemacht. Der von Tarek Müller (hier im OMR-Podcast)

gegründete Mitbewerber ist ein Content Marketing Powerhouse, das mit
Influencern nicht nur eigene Kollektionen und Marken auflegt, sondern
auch Dokus herausbringt. 
 Anfang des Jahres kündigte About You außerdem an
,
mit bekannten Personen aus der Hip-Hop-Szene die Shopping-Plattform
""WhyNot"" launchen zu wollen, mit einem Shop für Streetwear und
""Personal Brand""-Produkte sowie Content rund um Hip-Hop-Themen. Auf den
Streetwear-Markt schielt nun auch Zalando mit der
Highsnobiety-Übernahme: ""Die Zusammenarbeit mit Highsnobiety soll
Zalando dabei helfen, die erste Anlaufstelle für Streetwear, New Luxury
und Mode-Inspiration zu werden"", heißt es in der Pressemitteilung.
 Wenig verwunderlich, sind doch US-Sneaker- und -Streetwear-Marktplätze
wie beispielsweise StockX

mittlerweile Milliarden wert.

Der nächste Konflikt: Das Bundeskartellamt prüft, ob Apple mit ATT
seine Marktmacht gegenüber Werbetreibenden missbraucht
.
 Weltweit gehen Kartellbehörden und Unternehmen derzeit aus
verschiedenen Gründen gegen das Unternehmen vor, gerade erst musste
Apple im Streit gegen Tinder in den Niederlanden
50
Millionen Euro Strafe
zahlen.

 Klingende Kassen: Der russische Chat-Messenger Telegram, der vor allem
bei Verschwörungstheoretikern und politisch radikalen Gruppierungen
beliebt ist, launcht Ende des Monats eine Premium-Version. Das
Unternehmen verspricht zahlenden Nutzer:innen extra Features, mehr
Speicherplatz und eine höhere Geschwindigkeit.

 Werbung genehmigt: Google kündigt an, es konkurrierenden
Werbevermittlern künftig einfacher zu machen, Youtube-Ads zu vermitteln
.
 Damit will der größte Werbetreibende der Welt einer EU-Kartellstrafe
entgehen, die bis zu zehn Prozent eines Google-Jahresumsatzes ausmachen
könnte."

venture studios in the world. Her firm has built companies like
hims
& hers, Homebound, and Bungalow. But before Atomic, a turn
building
at Expa, and time at IVP (one of the foremost late stage VC firms
- and
investors in Twitter, Kayak, and Zynga), she was an investment
banking
analyst eager to break into VC.

 I’m excited to have her share with you what she learned during
her
first VC job hunt - which she was doing while working a very
demanding
investment banking job at Barclays.

 Much of what she shares here about her entry into VC and role at
IVP
applies to recruiting/hiring processes at both early and late
stage
firms - so listen up ;)

Without further ado, here’s Jordan…

I recruited for VC jobs in the spring of 2012 during my first
year at Barclays, where I was working as an investment banker.

"
628_1,1664465216,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How this VC got her job at a top firm,My recruiting process was fairly straightforward.
628_2,1664465216,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How this VC got her job at a top firm,"I met with some
headhunters (Glocap and Amity) who specialized in placing
Investment Banking analysts as associates in VC firms. I utilized
the VC Careers mailing list (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/p9uv74n755iqu5k65vfq/n2hohqu5q9nz9h6/aHR0cDovL2pvaG5nYW5ub25ibG9nLmNvbS92Yy1jYXJlZXJz
) as well as Christina Cacioppo's list (

) as resources. I also dropped my resume at several places that
posted an opening (e.g. online job boards or targeted mailing
lists)."
628_3,1664465216,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How this VC got her job at a top firm,"I definitely bombed a couple of interviews early in my process,
but the journey definitely taught me how to present myself as a
more viable candidate.

 So think of your VC job hunt a little bit like SAT prep - the
only way to get better at it is to do more of it.

 On that note, here are the key lessons that I learned during my
search:

1. The saying goes that you have a better shot of becoming a
professional athlete than a VC. I haven’t done the math, but the
bottom line is that VC openings are much more limited than the
number of folks who wants to get into the industry. At the
beginning of your process, make a list of the VC firms you’d
prefer to work for – either from a stage, geography, or focus
perspective. However, at some point your recruitment process will
turn into a numbers game. I’d like to say that you should be
strategic in which VC firms to approach, but the reality is that
it’s a buyer’s market.

2. Part of being a VC is having the luxury for being paid to
think. My interviews were always casual and conversational,
because the partner is ultimately trying to understand the way I
thought. There are only two ways to hone on-the-fly critical
thinking skills: read a lot and blog even more."
628_4,1664465216,john@startupcareeradvice.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,How this VC got her job at a top firm,"Be prepared to
present some of your theses with the reasoning to back them up.

Caching is the process of storing things (webpages, images, etc.)"
631_6,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"closer to whoever is requesting them so that those things load faster. 
 When you load a web page or an app, you’re requesting files from a server – and that server can be physically far away
Developers will cache content on servers closer to you so that those web pages and apps will load faster
 Because web page and apps change all the time, you can set a timer on cached content to force it to expire
Specialized server networks called CDNs let you cache content easily across the globe
 Almost every website you use is being cached in some format or another, and it’s an important part of how modern web apps are built (also, the kind of thing they don’t teach you in CS degrees).
 Saving private latency 
Nobody likes a slow web page (well, nobody that I know). But if you think about all of the stuff that needs to happen between you typing gmail.com into your browser and you actually seeing your email, it’s a complete miracle that it happens so fast – almost always in less than a second."
631_7,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"Let’s break it out:
Client makes a request to the server (i.e. you type in gmail.com)
Server figures out what to send back to the client (query databases, etc.)
 Server sends back assets (webpage, images, etc.) to client
Client’s browser renders the page and assets
That’s already a lot, and we haven’t even covered protocol procedures like TCP handshakes [ https://substack.com/redirect/dfd584d2-ea95-40e5-976f-f799b28f7b2e?r=o1saq ]. Each one of these steps takes time (usually a few hundred milliseconds), and when servers are far away, those steps can really add up. If you think about it, you can break down these “speed problems” into two core issues, which both conveniently start with the letter L:
Logic – there are a steps along the way to getting a web page loaded 
Location – servers can be very far away, and data takes time to travel
Caching helps solve these problems by storing readily available files (pre-made web pages, images, etc.) on special servers that are closer to an app’s end users. The shorter physical distance that the content has to travel speeds up load times, and the pre-built files save the original web server from having to deal with request logic again. 
 🤔 Undefined Terms 🤔
An origin server is the core web server that an app or site uses to respond to requests and build web pages. A proxy server is an intermediate server that stands between the user and the origin server and takes care of things like caching.
 🤔 Undefined Terms 🤔
Logistically, you cache files by either setting up a special server on your own (less common), or using a service like AWS Cloudfront [ https://substack.com/redirect/85da432a-3a3b-4e55-bd80-74ba2588659a?r=o1saq ] or Cloudflare [ https://substack.com/redirect/b46a59f8-d9fd-44fa-80a9-0e8e93127f4f?r=o1saq ]."

For that reason, companies put a lot of effort into making their sites and apps as fast as possible – and that’s the context for how caching helps.
"
631_11,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"Caching 101: RTT, TTL, and assorted acronyms
You can classify caching under the “Web Technologies and Protocols That Are Very Scary and Use a Lot of Acronyms” folder. Let’s walk through the anatomy of a cache and define some of the terms that you’ll come across.
RTT (Round Trip Time) – the total amount of time it takes from the moment that a user makes a request (you type a URL into your browser, or click a link) until the result gets returned to the requestor. The goal of a cache is to lower this.
"
631_12,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"TTL (Time to Live) – caches have one big problem: they’re static, which means that if you change your app (a new feature, a bug fix, etc.)"
631_13,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"the cache is still going to have the old version. To get around this, file caches usually carry a TTL (seconds, minutes, hours) - you can define how long you want your cached content to last for before it needs to get refreshed. 
 Hits and misses – developers often use the term “hit” to refer to when you make a request to the server and the content is cached (success!). A miss is when the content isn’t cached (or needs to be refreshed), so your request needs to go all the way to the origin server to get fulfilled.
 🚨 Confusion Alert 🚨
If there’s a cache miss, that doesn’t mean you don’t get your web page - it just means that the proxy server needs to forward your request on to the original server, get the results, send them to you, and then cache them for future use.
 🚨 Confusion Alert 🚨
CDN (Content Delivery Network) – building and operating your own servers just to implement a cache is kind of annoying, and there are options for outsourcing that. A CDN is a network of servers (usually global) that you can tap into and cache your content on: the classic example is Cloudflare, but AWS, Google, and Azure have their own too. 
"
631_14,1660668916,technically@substack.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,What's a Cache?,"Compression and minification – once you commit to using a cache, you can mess around with your files to make them easier to send across the web. If you’ve ever unzipped a file, you’re already familiar with compression, and a bunch of cache servers have compression protocols enabled by default. Developers will also minify their code by removing comments, spaces, new lines, and anything needed for human readability. Both of these make files smaller, which speeds up travel and lowers that key metric: RTT. 
 Types of caching: server and browser
The typical cache setup involves figuring out how to properly keep your files on a server, dealing with expiration via TTL, and all of that jazz. But a server or CDN isn’t the only place where caching happens; there’s plenty of data that’s cached right on your laptop, phone, or computer – in your browser. Browsers also cache things, especially if you’re visiting a site a lot.
 Your browser cache behaves like a specialized cache server, but saves even more time because your requests don’t have to leave your browser at all. For example: if you’re loading the New York Times homepage, basic parts of the layout like the boilerplate HTML or the CSS might get cached. That way, when you reload the page, you won’t need to fetch all of those files again.
 Browser caches help explain why reloading pages can be faster than loading pages the first time, and why you’ll sometimes have a “stale” page that you keep reloading but doesn’t show the new thing that you’re looking for. You can clear your browser cache [ https://substack.com/redirect/ab14a2f8-3a67-4d62-9789-40412843230b?r=o1saq ] whenever you want.

Caching your assets and using a CDN can have really significant impacts (think: 2x speed) on performance. Cloudflare does a great job of running through the numbers here [ https://substack.com/redirect/82d7ecd5-2035-4c60-b78a-1d252301f4ca?r=o1saq ]
 The benefit of a CDN [ https://substack.com/redirect/38828035-88e3-4bdf-b4dc-02b911dba721?r=o1saq ] is twofold: caching improves performance in general, and you can also take advantage of data centers available globally to be closer to your users

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

548.000 Instagram-Abonnent: innen und im Schnitt 220.000 Story Views -
solch ein VerhÃ¤ltnis und eine solche organische Sichtbarkeit sind fÃ¼r
klassische Marken nur sehr schwer zu erlangen. Der Influencerin Karo
Kauer hingegen gelingt das offenbar mit Leichtigkeit (was nicht heiÃŸen
soll, dass es keine harte Arbeit ist). Wenig erstaunlich also, dass zum
einen Influencer Marketing gut funktioniert, zum anderen aber auch
Influencer und Creator immer hÃ¤ufiger eigene Marken aufbauen, um von
dieser Reichweite noch mehr selbst zu profitieren. Wie Karo Kauer das
macht, das hat sie in ihrem Vortrag bei OMR22 erklÃ¤rt. Den kÃ¶nnt Ihr
jetzt komplett anschauen.

Widgets); App-Publisher sollen aber auch so genannte Live Notifications

auf den ""Lock Screen"" bringen kÃ¶nnen. Damit kÃ¶nnen sich die
Nutzer:innen beispielsweise laufend Ã¼ber den Spielstand bei sportlichen
WettkÃ¤mpfen informieren. FÃ¼r Publisher eine mÃ¤chtige Methode,
Nutzer:innen noch enger an sich zu binden.

Nutzer:innen in Apples App Ã–kosystem auswirken: Wenn Nutzer:innen nicht
gleich die komplette Summe zahlen mÃ¼ssen, sind sie kÃ¼nftig vielleicht
eher dazu bereit, fÃ¼r einen mobilen Service ein Jahresabo
abzuschlieÃŸen statt nur eines Monatsabos. 

 Und was ist mit ATT? Stellt Apple bei der WWDC ein Pendant zu Google
Topics

vor, also eine eigene Variante von ""datenschutzsicherem Targeting"",
Ã¼ber die Apple dann als Gatekeeper die Hand hÃ¤lt? Das zumindest hatte
sich Tech-Experte Benedict Evans vorab gefragt
. Nach dem
ersten Tag der WWDC kÃ¶nnen Mobile Advertiser erst einmal aufatmen, wie
Digiday schreibt
.
 Trotzdem heiÃŸt es abwarten, was Apple in der Session zur ""App Tracking
Transparency"" am Donnerstag neues vorstellt. Mobile-Experte Eric Seufert
erwartet wegen eines mysteriÃ¶sen Vorschaubildes immer noch eine
Topics-artige Targeting-Funktion

Shorts erstmals Werbung ausgeliefert werden, aus der heraus die

Q: After 7 years working at a big tech company, I am considering taking a couple of months break. Admittedly it feels a bit scary to do this now, given the state of the economy but I’ve been wanting to take a sabbatical for 3 years already. I am not sure what I would want to do during this time, I had a couple thoughts including travel for a few weeks and maybe take a programming course. I wanted to reach out to those of you who took a sabbatical to see if you had recommendations on what to do and things you enjoyed most during your sabbatical."

2. When to sunset a feature
 Q: I would love y’all’s advice and perspective on whether to sunset a feature or double down and try to build a V2. Thank you so much for your thoughts... here’s context on what I’m seeing:
there’s a feature that has not been “successful” (based on metrics we measure success here by) since it launched 5 years ago
when it launched, it was “V1”, but the team never prioritized getting it to the next level
it requires significant dev capacity to maintain

It helps reduce the amount of work that gets built and discarded.
 Sarah Krasnik: While I do find product to be hard to do as a consultant, another approach is to boil down product into a more operational role and position it that way. For instance, elements of product that don’t require the technical expertise of a CTO:
user interviews
product marketing
internal project management
This way, if the CTO wants to hold on to the strategic decision making aspect they can, while the data and execution of those strategic decisions can be outsourced.

Liebe OMR-Leser:innen,

heute mal wieder etwas zum Stirnrunzeln aus der Krypto-Welt: Ein
Kollektiv namens Wagdie (eine Anspielung auf das in der Szene in
hoffnungsvoller Stimmung verwendete Akronym WAGMI für ""We're all going
to make it"") hat eines der berühmten Mutant Ape NFTs gekauft. Schlappe
38.000 Dollar hat das Teil gekostet. Und dann haben sie es
unwiderruflich zerstört. Das ist ein bisschen, als würde man sich ein
neues Auto kaufen, nur um es im Fluss zu versenken."

""Google hat aufgegeben"": Diverse Publisher verabschieden sich von AMP

Mit den 2015 eingeführten ""Accelerated Mobile Pages"" (AMP) wollte
Google Publisher dazu bringen, ihre Seiten für Smartphone-Surfer
schneller zu machen - im Gegenzug sollten diese von Google mehr
Traffic bekommen. Doch im vergangenen Jahr haben sich nicht nur große
US-Digital-Publisher, sondern auch namhafte deutschsprachige Publisher
wieder davon gelöst. OMR zeichnet die Entwicklung des einstigen
Standards nach, führt Beispiele von Seiten an, die AMP abgeschaltet
haben, und zeigt, wie tief der Graben zwischen Google und
Online-Publishern mittlerweile ist.

 DAS WILL ICH LESEN  

 Microsoft verliert einen führenden Kopf für ihre
Metaverse-Pläne - und offenbart dadurch Fehler in der Firmenkultur

Alex Kipman, führender Kopf der Metaverse-Strategie von Microsoft, wird
das Unternehmen verlassen. Das geht aus einer internen Mail von
Microsofts Cloud und AI Vice President Scott Guthrie hervor, über die
das Wallstreet Journal zuerst berichtet.

 Der ""einvernehmlichen Trennung"" gehen Medienberichte vom Business
Insider voraus
,
in denen Kipman vorgeworfen wird, zahlreiche Mitarbeiter:innen
belästigt und Pornos am Arbeitsplatz geguckt zu haben. 

"
660_2,1654688816,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Bye Bye AMP,"Kipman, wer soll das sein? Alex Kipman war über 20 Jahre lang bei
Microsoft tätig und gilt als einer der Köpfe hinter der
Metaverse-Strategie des Konzerns. Er war unter anderem Hauptentwickler
der Hololens, einer AR/VR-Brille, deren erste Version 2015 launchte und
die es Nutzer:innen ermöglichen sollte, mit Hologrammen zu
interagieren."
660_3,1654688816,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Bye Bye AMP,"Und warum ist das wichtig? Im Kampf um die Vormachtstellung im neuen
Internet, dem Metaverse, herrscht ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen der
Techgrößen. Zwei der wichtigsten Konkurrenten: Microsoft und Meta.
 Während Metas Pläne als visionär, aber oft unkonkret gelten, werden
die von Microsoft als bedachter, aber vor allem auch konkreter
betrachtet
,
denn im Gegensatz zu Meta fokussierte sich Microsoft in seiner
Metaverse-Strategie auf praktische Tools, die den Berufsalltag
erleichtern sollten. Zuletzt, im März 2021, launchte Microsoft Mesh,
eine Weiterentwicklung der Kommunikationsplattform Teams, in der
Meetings mittels AR/VR-Brille komplett virtuell abgehalten werden
sollen. Hier soll auch Kipmans Hololens zum Einsatz kommen."
660_4,1654688816,newsletter@omr.com,tim.birkhofer@startglobal.org,,Bye Bye AMP,"Ohne Kipman, der mit der Hololens ein zentrales Element von Microsofts
Metaverse-Strategie entwickelte, könnte sich das Rennen zu Ungunsten
für Microsoft entwickeln. Insbesondere weil der Trennung pikante
Ereignisse vorausgehen, die ein schlechtes Bild auf Microsoft als
Unternehmen und dessen Firmenkultur werfen. 

 Genauer, bitte! Kipman habe bei Microsoft als ""Golden Boy"" gegolten,
einem so wichtigen Mitarbeiter, dass etwaige Verfehlungen keine
Konsequenzen gehabt haben. Darüber hat Business Insider vor rund zwei
Wochen berichtet
;
in dem Artikel berufen sich die Autor:innen auf Angestellte des
Unternehmens, die anonym bleiben möchten. Als Satya Nadella vor rund
acht Jahren seine Position als CEO von Microsoft antrat, versprach er
genau dieser Firmenkultur den Garaus zu machen. Erfolglos, wie sich am
Beispiel Kipman nun herausstellt. Eine Verbindung zwischen Kipmans
Karriereende und den vorausgegangenen Vorwürfen ist allerdings nicht
bestätigt. 

‍☠️ Newsbites: 

**Instagram, Amazon, Linktree**

* *Filterblase:** Instagram ermöglicht Nutzer:innen nun, mehr ""sensible
Inhalte"" aus dem Explore-Feed zu filtern. Um welche Art von Inhalten es
sich genau handelt, ist aber nicht zu 100 Prozent klar
.

 **Plagiate per Prime:** Der Online-Händler Amazon hat nach eigenen
Angaben Millionen gefälschter Produkte aus dem Verkehr gezogen. Erfolge
beim Kampf gegen die Produkt-Piraterie sind offenbar messbar
.

 Marktplatz-in-Bio: Linktree launcht einen eigenen Marktplatz für
Creator. Über den Link in der Bio können User künftig direkt Songs
streamen, Merch shoppen oder etwa Geld spenden.

 A Message from Sweater Ventures: The Venture Capital Fund for EVERYONE

For too long the venture capital asset class has been out of reach for the majority of investors…until now.

 Sweater ( http://url495.execsum.co/ss/c/QPgH8zGLXEhy0-wgSbIcTVn2RoPsZ5GUCgJseos_z2GuIRKQTHtMJZ4b5V42FVMnBFi0bybKB9NUEm89RgeWOg/3mz/AuNiP9YaSh-tHOfW736rZw/t21/RhztiDa-5iNAojMj5fwJDBbL_-_gPKMNpyidZN5C-Rk ) opens venture investing for everyday investors, regardless of accreditation status. 

 The venture capital space was begging for change. The majority of investors—even founders, analysts, and venture insiders—couldn’t meet the requirements for most of the existing paths into venture investing, so we decided to reshape the landscape for everyone, for you.

 With the Sweater app, you can start investing in venture capital with a low upfront investment and grow your position in the fund with automatic recurring investments. We report on the investments we make right back to you through the app.

Hey Manuel,

Ich bin jetzt nach zwei erfolgreichen Jahren fertig mit meinem Engagement bei START und plane nächstes Semester für den Austausch nach Israel zu gehen. In den letzten zwei Jahren ist mir durch START, aber auch insbesondere durch deinen Blockkurs, klar geworden dass ich in einem Tech-Startup arbeiten möchte bzw. langfristig auch die Absicht habe, zu gründen.

 Für die Bewerbung an der Reichman University benötige ich zwei Empfehlungsschreiben, welche direkt per Mail an diese Mail Adresse (RRIS.registrar@idc.ac.il) gesendet werden. Daher wollte ich fragen, ob du mich bei der Universität für das Austausch Programm empfehlen könntest?

 Der Einfachheit halber habe ich schon etwas vorgeschrieben, dass du so weiterleiten könntest, wenn das für dich in Ordnung wäre.

 Beste Grüsse und vielen Dank für deine Hilfe!
